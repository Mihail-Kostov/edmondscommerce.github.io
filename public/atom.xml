    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Magento has become aware of a vulnerability requiring patching as soon as possible. The vulnerability allows an attacker to send a specially crafted request to a Magento store and allow it to run Magento code as though it were on the live server. Magento aren&rsquo;t aware of this having been used in the wild, but now that the vulnerability is public, attackers may use it against existing stores.</p>

<p>This vulnerability affects all versions of Magento, and Magento have released patches for versions Community Edition 1.6 to 1.9, and Enterprise 1.11 to 1.14.</p>

<p>The fix is to apply some stricter IP address checks to requests.</p>

<h3>Patching your Magento store</h3>

<p>To get the patch:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Community Edition</strong> users should go to the <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/download">Magento downloads page</a> and scroll to the &ldquo;Magento Community Edition Patches&rdquo; section. From there, select your version of Magento and click Download</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise Edition</strong> users should log into their Magento account Magento Support Portal</li>
</ul>


<p>You&rsquo;ll be presented with a shell file which will make the necessary changes to your store. Upload this patch to your server in the Magento root and run it against your store.</p>

<p>The patch changes core files, and it&rsquo;s always recommended to test changes on a development copy before the live site, especially if you have modifications to your core code. Also keep in mind that any upgrades pre-1.9.0.1 will remove these changes, and the patch will have to be re-run.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>cd /your/magento/root/</code> &ndash; Navigate to the root of Magento</li>
<li><code>./sh PATCH_SUPEE-5344_CE_1.8.0.0_v1.sh</code> &ndash; Run the patches</li>
<li><code>rm PATCH_SUPEE-5344_CE_1.8.0.0_v1.sh</code> &ndash; Delete the patch file, so that it can&rsquo;t be re-run by the public</li>
<li><code>rm -rf var/cache/*</code> &ndash; Clear Magento&rsquo;s cache</li>
</ol>


<p>Reload a page and the patch will have taken effect.</p>
