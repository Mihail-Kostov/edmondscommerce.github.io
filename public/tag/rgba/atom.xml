<p>I recently came across rgba colours which are a very simple and logical way to produce a colour (rgb) with alpha transparency as well. This is ideal if for example you want to create a translucent white box to put some text in.</p>

<p>CSS does have some (dodgy) opacity controls, but they set everything as transparent including any text or pictures contained within the element. By using rgba, we can set a translucent background colour and have opaque elements contained within.</p>

<p>As usual, to get it to work in IE requires some extra effort, however this hack mentioned  <a href="http://css-tricks.com/rgba-browser-support/">here</a> and originally credited <a href="http://www.hedgerwow.com/360/dhtml/rgba/demo.php">here</a> seems to offer a solution.</p>
