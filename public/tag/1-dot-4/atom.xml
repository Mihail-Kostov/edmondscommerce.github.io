<p>If you upgrade to Magento version 1.4 and find that your admin totally stops working then this might be for you.</p>

<p>If you view source and notice that your javascript paths are totally wrong then it could be that Merge JavaScript Files is causing it.</p>

<p>The answer is:</p>

<p>go to System &ndash;> Configuration &ndash;> Developer Settings &ndash;> Javascript Settings &ndash;> Merge JavaScript Files (beta) and set it to &ldquo;no&rdquo;. It is realy a beta :D</p>

<p>However &ndash; you can&rsquo;t because your admin it totally not working..</p>

<p>So the other answer is to go to the core_config_data table and set the path dev/js/merge_files to 0</p>

<p>However &ndash; on checking ours, that row was not even in the core_config_data table.</p>

<p>The final solution was to add a new row, setting the path to dev/js/merge_files and the value to 0.</p>

<p>If your shiny new Magento 1.4 is displaying this error message at the bottom of the page then you might want to apply this fix.</p>

<p><strong>Fatal error: Exception thrown without a stack frame in Unknown on line 0</strong></p>

<p>The solution is to comment out a small section of code in</p>

<p>app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/Cache.php</p>

<p>line 180</p>

<p>```php</p>

<pre><code>            /*try {
                if (class_exists($type, true)) {
                    $implements = class_implements($type, true);
                    if (in_array('Zend_Cache_Backend_Interface', $implements)) {
                        $backendType = $type;
                    }
                }
            } catch (Exception $e) {
            }*/
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>
