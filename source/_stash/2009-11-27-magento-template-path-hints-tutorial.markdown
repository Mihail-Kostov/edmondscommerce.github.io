I often need to refer to instructions on how to turn on the template path hints in Magento. This is an indispensable feature for anyone working with any element of Magento design customisation. 

Once you start to see the logic of the Magento design folder structure, it becomes less of a requirement but even then there will be times where it can be a life saver for tracking down the particular phtml file that you need to edit.

Here is a nice video tutorial:
