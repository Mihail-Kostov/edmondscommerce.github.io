I have put together an XAMPP based portable Magento demo site. You can easily download it to your windows PC, drop the xampp folder into the root of your C: drive, launch the XAMPP control panel to start Apache and MySQL and then you are away.

You can get the files on GitHub here:

Please read the README which is displayed at the bottom of the GitHub page for up to date instructions.
