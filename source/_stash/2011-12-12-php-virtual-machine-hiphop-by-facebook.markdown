We told you about <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/php/php-into-compiled-c-hip-hop-by-facebook/">HipHop</a> a while back and we were pretty excited about it.

You can read the full story <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150415177928920">here</a>.

We suspect it is still some way before this kind of thing will be more widely adopted but its certainly a good thing for PHP.
