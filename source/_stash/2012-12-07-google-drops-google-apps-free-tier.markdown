In a move that will hurt a lot of small businesses and especially startups, Google have withdrawn their free Google Apps for Domains which has been slowly reducing in number of users from 50, to 10 to now 0 (almost).

They are keeping the existing accounts open so if you have Google Apps already, don't panic yet, your data is still there.

For one-man-band startups apparently there is the option of creating a single-user apps account still apparently, according to Greg D'Alesandre of Google.
