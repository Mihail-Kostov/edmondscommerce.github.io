If you are browsing around a load of files on your object oriented project using the great features like right click -> go to definition, then you like me are probably also hankering after a nice backwards and forwards functionality so you can easily jump between places in your project.

After a bit of looking around, it seems that you can by either using the Navigation menu or the key combinations [alt]+[<-] (left arrow) for back and [alt]+[->]  (right arrow) for forwards.

That's better, however a pair of toolbar buttons would be even better, but I can't seem to find a way to do that. Seems a shame when the functionality is there not to be able to create those buttons. 

If you know of a way to do it please add it to the comments!
