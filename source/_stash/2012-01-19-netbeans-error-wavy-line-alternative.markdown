If you use Netbeans then you have no doubt seen the red wavy underline that pops under lines that have errors.

Unfortunatley if your errors relate to punctuation, eg concatenation full stops, then the red wavy line can actually obscure these making finding and fixing the error tricky.

An nice alternative is to set Netbeans to use a red strikethrough instead of the wavy line. This is just as visilble but does not obscure punctuation in any way making finding and fixing the error a lot easier.

To change this simply go to Tools->Options->Fonts & Colors

Then Set Language to All Languages

Then select Error in the category drop down

Simply change the Effects: drop down from Wave Underlined line to Strike Through
