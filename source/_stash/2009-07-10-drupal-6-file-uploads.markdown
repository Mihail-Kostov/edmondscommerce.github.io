It's always tempting when  you are new to a framework or system to just roll your own functionality if the built in functionality is not obvious. I was nearly at that stage with Drupal 6 file uploads. Thankfully before I gave in I found this useful blog post which clearly states how Drupal's built in file upload functionality works. Sweet :-)
