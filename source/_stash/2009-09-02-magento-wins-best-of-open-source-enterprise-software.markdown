Magento, the ecommerce package that everyone is talking about at the moment and that Edmonds Commerce have been keeping a close eye on for the past couple of years or so has won the <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/open-source/best-open-source-enterprise-software-740&current=7&last=14#slideshowTop">best of open source enterprise software award</a> for the second year running.

Run by InfoWorld, the awards highlight the cream of the current open source crop. Unsurprisingly Drupal came out top for content management, it is definitely the CMS that Edmonds Commerce would recommend and Magento took the Ecommerce Crown. The blog award went to wordpress (what an awesome application).
