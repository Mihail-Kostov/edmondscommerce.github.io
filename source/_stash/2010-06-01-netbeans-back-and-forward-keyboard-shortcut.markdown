Simple one this but I keep forgetting it.

To navigate around the code you can use [cntrl] + left or right arrow to go Forward or Back 

its a big time saver, but for some reason the keyboard shortcut doesn't show under the Navigate drop down menu, which makes you think there isn't a keyboard shortcut set up - but there is.
