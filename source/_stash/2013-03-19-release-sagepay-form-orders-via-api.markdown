If you use SagePay Form integration then you might think that it is impossible to release orders created via this integration system via the API.

Historically this was true however thanks to the new admin and reporting API you can now grab all of the details you need to perform the kind of admin side integration previously only possible via Server and Direct integrations.

This does take a bit of work but if you like the fact that Form alleviates PCI compliance issues, allows your customers to use the nice easy to use Form interface and also gives you easy PayPal integration then this is a great solution.

Thanks goes out to SagePay's technical support who have proved really helpful in ironing out the kinks in getting this working.
