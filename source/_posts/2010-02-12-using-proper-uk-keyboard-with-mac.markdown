Contiuing my project to get my Mac to feel like a proper PC and not cause me mental strain every time I switch to it from Ubuntu, I have started using a proper UK keyboard and have now found out how to make it have the correct keymapping.

For full details go here:

In a nutshell though:

download this file:
http://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/resources/2005/11/20/british-windows-3.keylayout.gz

Then unzip it and put it in:

/Users/{yourname}/Library/Keyboard Layouts/

Then go to System Preferences -> International -> Input Menu

you should see just below british something called British 3. Tick that box and also ensure the box at the bottom is ticked ('Show input menu in menu bar')

Then restart the machine and you should have proper UK keyboard, with an easily accessible # key - woot! :D
