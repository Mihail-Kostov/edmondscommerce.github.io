Another nice and good looking Magento design implementation work for a project that was being migrated from Joomla platform to Magento. We took on board the work that was started with other developers and basically make it work as per client requirements. 

We did some work on SEO, Implementing Hello Theme design and migrating clean up from the old site. The site is not yet launched though you can see the original site here <a href="http://mobilecadsurveying.co.uk/">http://mobilecadsurveying.co.uk/</a>. Note by the time you read this it may well have been updated.

<h3>Here are some screen shots of the final Magento theme.</h3>
