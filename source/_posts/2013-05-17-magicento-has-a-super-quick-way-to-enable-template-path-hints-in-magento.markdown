Magento's Template Path Hints feature can be super handy for working out which templates are in use, but <em>logging into the Admin, navigating to System, Configuration, Developer, Debug, Change Store Scope, Change to Yes, Press Save, Reload</em> is an arduous process. So much so that often it's easier to just suss it out from the folder structure.

No more! Magicento has an entry in its menu to enable these at the click of a menu item.

There's a couple of settings which need to be enabled (see below) but once set up, it works great.
