The scenario here is that you have access to two servers - old and new - and you want to copy a site + database from old server to new server directly.

You have root SSH access to both servers.

<strong>1. Create  a TAR archive of the document root for the site on the old server.</strong>
Log into SSH on the old server.

Navigate to your vhost root (the folder just above httpdocs) then use the following command to make a tar archive of your entire httpdocs folder:
```

tar -cvvf httpdocs.tar httpdocs/

```

<strong>2. Gzip the TAR archive</strong>
```
 gzip httpdocs.tar
```

<strong>3. Transer the File to the New Server</strong>
Log into SSH on the new server

This bit may change according to your specific server setups. The way I approached this was to log into the new server  at the vhost root where I want to import the old httpdocs folder. I then use the following SCP command to log into the old server, find my archive and copy it to the current location. 

I am using a custom port (not the real one in the example of course) for SSH so that must be specified. Unlike SSH, you must use a capital P to specify a custom port

<em><strong>Note the space and full stop at the end - they are very important!</strong></em>

```

scp -P 1111 old_server_username@123.123.123.123:/path/to/file/on/old/server/archive.tar.gz .

```

<strong>4. Dump all DB's and Transfer</strong>
To dump all of the databases into one single file we can use the following mysqldump syntax. Note you can simply use the --all-databases switch but this will backup database that you probably don't want to include. Better to declare a list of all the DB's that you do want.
```

mysqldump -u SomeUser -p --databases mydb1 mydb2 mydb3 > myDbs.sql

```

Once you have this dump file you can Gzip it and transfer it via SCP using the same kind of commands as above.
