There are some very complicated aspects to a successful on page search engine optimisation strategy. However there are also some incredibly simple ones. 

At the very top of the list of simple things you can do to improve your SEO is to make sure that your &#60;&#116;&#105;&#116;&#108;&#101;&#62; tag contains a unique and descriptive page title for each and every page of your web site.

If you have a smaller site with not too many pages then you can handle this by hand. On the other hand, if you have an ecommerce store for example with hundreds or thousands of products and categories then it is going to be easier to build in some kind of dynamic title functionality. 

Edmonds Commerce have helped out numerous web masters by implementing a bespoke and automatic dynamic meta tag system which creates a highly optimised title for each and every page.
