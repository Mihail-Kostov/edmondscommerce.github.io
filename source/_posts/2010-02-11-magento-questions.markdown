If you have any Magento related questions and are struggling to get help on the main forums, or you just fancy somewhere a bit quieter and possibly more UK focussed to ask your magento related questions, then check out this <a href="http://www.magento-forum.co.uk">UK Magento Forum</a>.

We have been heavily involved in it from the outset and are currently commited to answering any questions that come up as helpfully and promptly as possible.
