My favourite PHP framework of the moment, Symfony, is now moving to my favourite version control system - Git.

read more about it <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/blog/2010/01/13/symfony-2-migration-to-git">Symfony 2 Migration to Git</a>

Its only for the version 2 release, but its a nice step forwards. Github is a really nice system.

The blog post also mentions this great online Git book:

<a href="http://progit.org/">Pro Git</a>

Not actually come across that before, will be handy.
