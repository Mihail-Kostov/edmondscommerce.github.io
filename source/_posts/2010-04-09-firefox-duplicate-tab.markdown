Firefox used to have an addon called duplicate tab. It was great, did exactly what it said on the tin. However it is no longer developed and so we are stuck without any duplicate tab functionality - damn.

Until that is I discovered tabberwocky. Not the most descriptive name which is probably why it didn't come up in my Google searches. However I have now found it and among other things it allows us to duplicate tabs easily. 

Hopefully this post will be more optimised for <strong>firefox duplicate tab</strong>. If that's what you are looking for, then you are looking for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/14439">Tabberwocky</a>
