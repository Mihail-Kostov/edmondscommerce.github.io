description: "Ebay has had a data breach so it's time to change your passwords again"
---

It is being reported that there has been a database breach at eBay leading to the leaking of encrypted passwords

Whilst there has not been any reported access to user accounts it is worth updating your password for eBay and any other site that share the same password

It is considered bad practice to have the same password for multiple site, so to help me keep track of all of them I use [lastpass](https://lastpass.com) to make the job simpler

The full statement for ebay is available [here](http://www.ebayinc.com/in_the_news/story/ebay-inc-ask-ebay-users-change-passwords)
