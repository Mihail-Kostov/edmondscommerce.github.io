If you use an external drive on your Mac and find yourself looking at the spinning colour wheel all the time waiting for the drive to spin up again, then this tip is for you.

Just go into system preferences and then energy saving and untick the box that says "put the hard drives to sleep when possible".

There are more elegant solutions allowing you to control spin down timeouts, but this is the quick fix.
