UK based, highly skilled Magento developers are available to hire from Edmonds Commerce to work on yours or your clients projects.

Magento is an open source e-commerce platform written in PHP that has taken the world of e-commerce by storm. There are two versions of Magento available - Magento Community and Magento Enterprise.

The Community edition is perfect for most people. The Enterprise edition is the one you should use if you are more of an enterprise level business rather than a small SME or sole trader business.

Edmonds Commerce have been working with Magento for a few years now and have clients across the globe using both versions of the platform.

Our seasoned developers are all Zend Certified Engineers and the majority are Magento Certified Developers meaning your project will enjoy the highest levels of developer skill.
