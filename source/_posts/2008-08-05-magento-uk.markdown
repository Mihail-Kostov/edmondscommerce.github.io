Magento is certainly making waves. For those of you who haven't heard of it, Magento is looking likely to become the successor to osCommerce as the most popular open source ecommerce platform.

There are many things which make Magento a much better option than osCommerce. However for some people the tried and tested, 'better the devil you know', huge knowledge, customisation and support base of osCommerceÂ  makes it the platform they would still prefer to put their development investment into.

These justifications are valid to a point, however I now believe that the time is right to move into Magento and whilst I am not certain that it is worth worrying about upgrading if you already have a perfectly functional osCommerce site, I would recommend anyone looking to set up a new ecommerce site takes a close look at Magento.
