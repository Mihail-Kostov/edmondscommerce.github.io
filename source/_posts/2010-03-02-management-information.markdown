This could manifest in a lower number of customers cancelling orders. It could mean better accounting systems that maximise settlement discounts. It could mean higher levels of customer satisfaction which engender profitable repeat purchases. The liklihood is that every aspect of your <a href="../../marketing/business/" title="Information Explaining Business">Business</a> will benefit from an effective management information system.
