We are currently looking for a new PHP developer to join our team. 

The ideal candidate will be a highly competent PHP developer comfortable working with both procedural and object oriented PHP code. We focus nearly entirely on ecommerce, mainly osCommerce (and derivatives such as Zen Cart, CRE Loaded etc) and of course Magento.

More and more though, Magento is what we are working on, so if you are more comfortable with object oriented coding than procedural that's not too much of a problem. If you don't know OO coding though, you might struggle with Magento.

Along with a high level of PHP competency, we would also expect a good grounding in HTML, CSS and Javascript. Any other skills that you have will also be appreciated.

If you are in the Leeds area (or able to commute to Leeds easily enough) and would like to discuss the role, please send us an email via the <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/contact-about-jobs.html">contact form</a>.
