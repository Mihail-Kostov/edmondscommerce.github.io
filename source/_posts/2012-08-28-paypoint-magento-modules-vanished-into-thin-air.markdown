It appears that all the paypoint (formally secpay) modules have vanished from the magento connect site.

This is a pain for a lot of people who have chosen the gateway to service their payments, and leaves two options for most people :-
<ul>
	<li>* Choose a different provider</li>
	<li>* Get a custom module written</li>
</ul>
As Magento developers we're happy to quote for the latter option, but we expect a lot of people will go for the former.
