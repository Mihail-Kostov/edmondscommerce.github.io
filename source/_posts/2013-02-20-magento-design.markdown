One of the first things that users will notice about your web site is the design. The visual aspects of your site, the colour scheme, layout and also the general user experience (or UX in web speak) all contribute to the users impressions and willingness to interact with your site and go forth to place an order.

These days web design means more than just making it pretty, it also means making it work well across a variety of devices. For e-commerce sites we always recommend that clients look for a design that is clean and clear and does not get in the way of the core business of letting the user easily and quickly find the product they need and go through to purchase.

There are many choices when implementing a design for your Magento site and the budget range is significant - in fact the design is probably the most elastic part of any Magento implementation. 

If you want to keep costs as low as possible we highly recommend you have a look at some of the excellent Magento themes that you can purchase for around the Â£100 mark. Of course there are some free ones and Magento is bundled with a small selection. In general these are so overused that it we recommend steering away from these and looking for something a little bit more exlcusive.

The next step up is to choose a template as a baseline but then get a visual design created that customises the template into something that is bespoke to your requirements. The level of customisation is really up to you and this is where the price elasticity comes into play, the more customisation the more you will need to budget.

Finally the top drawer service is a fully bespoke design implementation. This gives you the greatest levels of exclusivity and flexiblity. It means you will get a full design package that is perfectly tailored to your branding and target market.

Its worth considering at the design stage how you want to handle the experience that visitors using mobile or tablet devices will be delivered. Your options are essentially to serve up the exact same site as the normal desktop user, to have a custom theme delivered to these users or the solution we prefer is to implement a responsive design that will adapt to different screen sizes dynamically allowing a single web site theme to work across devices.
