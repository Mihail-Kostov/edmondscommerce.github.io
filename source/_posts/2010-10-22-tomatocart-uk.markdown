Edmonds Commerce are big believers in open source software and especially open source ecommerce packages which are our speciality.

There is an excellent selection of open source ecommerce platforms available today including Magento and Open Cart, old favourites like osCommerce (Zen Cart, CRE Loaded) and Presta Shop.

One that you might not have heard of though that is definitely worth a look is <a href="http://www.tomatocart.com" target="_blank">TomatoCart</a>. The key wow factor in this cart is the RIA style admin that basically looks and feels like a windows desktop. This makes it very intuitive and powerful to use and definitely feels like the way the web based apps of the future will work. Check out the <a href="http://www.tomatocart.com/products/store-demo.html" target="_blank">demo</a>

TomatoCart is a direct descendant of oscommerce and is based on the oscommerce 3 codebase (which never made it beyond alpha status). It comes feature packed as standard with a slick and intuitive front end with features like image zoom, home page slide show and product comparison. You can read the full list of features <a href="http://www.tomatocart.com/products/features.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
