If you are using Google apps and have two factor authentication turned on then you are probably using the convenient "Remember this PC for 30 days" feature.

If you like your browser to forget every thing except a very select set of data (bookmarks, etc.) but keep the convenience of the 30 day authentication then you only need to keep the cookie called "SMSV" for the domain "www.google.com" with path "/a".

There is a variety of ways you can keep this cookie. You could, for example, export it then import it when ever (and where ever) you need it.
