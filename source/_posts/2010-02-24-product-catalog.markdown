<h1>Handle Vast Product Catalogues with Ease</h1><br/><p>Many <a href="../../ecommerce/" title="Information Explaining Ecommerce">Ecommerce</a> packages currently available do have some nice product handling systems built in, allowing you to insert and update products one by one. This is fine for occasional work, editing the odd product or adding a couple of new releases. However, if you are thinking of taking on a whole new line or there has recently been a new price list release, the task of updating products one by one is daunting at best and may prove to be impossible.</p><h2>Bulk Catalogue Handling</h2><p>Those with a bit more experience in the <a href="../../ecommerce/" title="Information Explaining Ecommerce">Ecommerce</a> field will probably be familiar with handling product catalogues in bulk, using excel or similar to deal with the entire catalogue as a spread sheet and then reuploading to achieve bulk updates. Likewise with image processing, the more advanced <a href="../../ecommerce/" title="Information Explaining Ecommerce">Ecommerce</a> <a href="../../marketing/business/" title="Information Explaining Business">Business</a>es will use batch processing in a program like Photoshop to manipulate entire folders of images. This is a great way of working and if you do not already have this facility, we can help you build it into your systems and train you up on using them to achieve greater efficency.</p><h2>Full Product Automation</h2><p>Bulk products tools are an excellent way to achieve greater efficiency and are a must have facility for any serious <a href="../../ecommerce/" title="Information Explaining Ecommerce">Ecommerce</a> <a href="../../marketing/business/" title="Information Explaining Business">Business</a>. However, the possibilities do not end there. Depending on where you source your product information from, it is entirely possible to build a tool which will keep your product catalogue completely up to date, with the latest description, trade price information and images without you having to do more than click a few buttons.</p><h2>How Does it Work</h2><p>Without going into excessive details, suffice to say that most things that you (or your staff) could do on a computer, a small program can be written to do the same task at computer speeds and with computer accuracy. Furthermore, this can be done out of hours, overnight and as often as you wish!</p>
