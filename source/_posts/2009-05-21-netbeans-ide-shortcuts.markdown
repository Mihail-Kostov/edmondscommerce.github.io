I really like NetBeans IDE for coding PHP. However there are lots of hidden features which are only accessible via keyboard shortcut.

<a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/RubyShortcuts" rel="nofollow">This page</a> lists a bunch of them. Its titled Ruby Shortcuts, but they seem to work just as well for PHP.
