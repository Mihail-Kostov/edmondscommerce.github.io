This is as much a note to self as anything else. If you are migrating a Magento store or creating a copy of a store - if you use phpMyAdmin to create the database dump things can all go wrong.

Instead save yourself the hassle and just use the admin backups functionality. You can then import this using phpMyAdmin without any problems
