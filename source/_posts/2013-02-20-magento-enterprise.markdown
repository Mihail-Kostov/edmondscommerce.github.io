Magento comes in two main versions, the popular and freely available Community Edition and the more rounded and fully featured Enterprise Edition which is targeted at larger enterprises that require extended features, warranty and support that come with the purchase of a Magento Enterprise licence. 

For the very large enterprise the best solution is the Magento Enterprise Premium bundle which included multiple licences for running a server cluster and also includes greater support and guidance to ensure that your web site is built to the highest standards and avoids any pitfalls.
