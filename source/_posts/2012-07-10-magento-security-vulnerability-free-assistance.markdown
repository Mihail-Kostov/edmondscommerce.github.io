The magento platform is based on a PHP framework called Zend Framework.

Recently a bug was found in Zend Framework which potentially allows attackers to read any file on your server. This could mean they could gain access to your mysql server credentials for example.

You can read the full details <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/blog/comments/update-zend-framework-vulnerability-security-update/">here</a>.

The actual bug details for Zend Framework are in this <a href="http://framework.zend.com/security/advisory/ZF2012-01">security advisory</a>.
