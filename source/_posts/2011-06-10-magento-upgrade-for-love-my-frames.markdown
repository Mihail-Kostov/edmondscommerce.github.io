<h2>Magento Upgrade with Custom Modules Rewrite</h2>

The aim of this project was to upgrade a store from 1.3 to 1.5, without losing the functionality of the site. The old version had had its core files modified, requiring a forensic examination of them in order to find and extract what had been changed.

<h3>Love My Frames</h3>

Love My Frames is run by highly trained technicians with over 40 years' optical experience, offering the kind of personal service you would normally expect from a high street opticians. Offering the best for considerably less, professional service and door-to-door delivery, they give their customers the ultimate shopping experience online plus the opportunity to purchase the <a href=”http://www.lovemyframes.com/” >very latest designs at a great price</a>.

The project asked for a clean install and then rewrite of the existing store. The biggest part of the project was taking the existing layered navigation and rewriting it to work on all pages with a custom design.
