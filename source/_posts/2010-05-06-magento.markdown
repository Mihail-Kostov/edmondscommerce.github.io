<b>Edmonds Commerce</b> are <b>Magento Experts</b>.

We deliver full <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/">Magento</a> based ecommerce web sites and are also happy to work on existing Magento sites. We can do everything from upgrades, design changes, tweaks and custom module development to handle all kinds of functionality requirements.

To help you get the most out of your Magento store, we also offer proper <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/magento/magento-training-uk/">Magento Training Courses</a> that are invaluable for people who are going to run a Magento store and want to ensure they have the best understanding and can get the most out of their Magento based web site.

Magento is without a doubt our favourite ecommerce platform right now. We have built numerous sites on Magento including sites with large catalogues, multiple stores, heavy customisation requirements and of course plenty of simple small single store sites.

The power of Magento is quite astounding for someone who is used to more traditional ecommerce platforms. Without having to make any major modifications it is possible to create a Magento implementation for all kinds of different client requirement scenarios ranging from retail to wholesale, virtual items to mail order.

The visual design side of Magento is incredibly clever and totally separated from the core logic of the system. This makes for a more robust and reliable platform and also gives a very high level of flexibility in terms of the visual possibilities for a Magento site.
