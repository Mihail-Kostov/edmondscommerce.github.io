Another tasteful Magento work we did was this project specializing in selling products for pets. Other than consultation we installed this nice and simple Magento theme and set up a WordPress blog  for the client.

We ensured that the WordPress blog and the store run seamlessly and that the two websites persist the same feel and look as closely as possible.
