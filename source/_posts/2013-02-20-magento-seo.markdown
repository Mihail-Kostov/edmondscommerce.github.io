As standard Magento comes with some excellent SEO features meaning that with little effort your site can be highly optimised for SEO. That said like anything there is always more that can be done. In the world of SEO this is generally always true, its an ongoing effort to keep your site at the top of the listings.

There are two main aspects to SEO which is 'on the page' SEO meaning the content and structure of your Magento site and then 'off page' SEO which involves building links and content external to your site.
