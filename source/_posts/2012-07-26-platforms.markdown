Edmonds Commerce Work on a wide range of platforms.

<h3>Magento</h3>
The most popular platform we are currently working on is Magento. Magento is a very powerful e-commerce package that is based upon Zend Framework. It is hugely feature rich and is suitable for all kinds of businesses right up to large enterprises.

<h3>OpenCart</h3>
Open Cart is a very nice lighter weight e-commerce system that combines the shared hosting friendly light weight of something like osCommerce with a more modern structure and plenty of features out of the box. Highly recommended for those on a budget or those who would prefer to trade off functionality for ease of use and high performance on lower specification hosting.

<h3>PrestaShop</h3>
Prestashop sits in between OpenCart and Magento. It is not as light as OpenCart but is also not as feature rich as Magento. Originally harking from Paris, France Prestashop now also has an office in Miami, USA. The most recent Prestashop version has introduced multi store functionality making it a real alternative to Magento for those looking to set up a multistore based installation.

<h3>osCommerce</h3>
Another very popular platform, at least historically, is osCommerce.  osCommerce was branched off into other versions including Zen Cart, CRELoaded, LoadedCommerce, OSCMax and a few more to boot. osCommerce is really quite dated these days however if you are already heavily invested into it then moving away might not be economically viable. Edmonds Commerce are more than happy to work with all kinds of osCommerce implementation to improve, add features, improve performance and any thing else you might require.

<h3>WordPress</h3>
For really well search engine optimised content driven websites and blogs we really highly recommend WordPress. It is an excellent platform out of the box and combined with one of the many high quality themes and some choice plugins you can build a really successful website in a short time. Edmonds Commerce have lots of experience with WordPress and have used it for content sites that often sit seamlessly alongside installations of platforms such as <a href="/platforms/magento">Magento</a> to give you the best of breed in e-commerce and content management for the maximum benefit to you.

<h3>Drupal</h3>
If you are looking to build a large scale content or community driven site for things like public sector portals, community driven sites and forums then Drupal is an excellent choice. Drupal is arguably more of a framework than an application, the focus is very much on extending the Drupal core to cater for your specific needs using a collection of the thousands of Drupal modules or even using a pre packaged Drupal distribution. Edmonds Commerce are very happy to work on Drupal projects utilising our high level of PHP web development skill and experience to deliver an enterprise level service.
