So, this is documented in the manual, but isn't obvious in any menu :-

To uppercase a selection, press Control+U then U.
To lowercase a selection, press Control+U then L.
and to reverse case in the selection (for when you have typed a whole line of code without checking your caps lock!), press Control+U then S.

Really useful but not well known.
