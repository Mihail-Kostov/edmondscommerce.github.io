Today we and no doubt countless other Ubuntu 10.10 users got the dreaded:

You can read the official announcement <a href="http://fridge.ubuntu.com/2012/04/10/ubuntu-10-10-maverick-meerkat-end-of-life-reached-on-april-10-2012/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ubuntu-10-10-maverick-meerkat-end-of-life-reached-on-april-10-2012">here</a>.
As everyone is aware, Ubuntu and Gnome have both moved towards a new desktop environment paradigm which is designed to be a bit more dumbed down and accessible to less technical users.

Unfortunately its not really suitable for power users who might have a LOT of open windows spread over multiple desktops and often running multiple monitors.

Gnome 2, simple as it was, has some really nice desktop features that once you are used to them it feels like you can't live without them.

So now the big question is, what next?

We already have one Linux Mint fan in the office and it is looking like this project is going in the right kind of direction for us with their support for MATE (Gnome 2 basically) and also the Cinnamon desktop which is a more modern take on the classic Gnome 2 desktop paradigm. Its more than likely this is where we will be going to next.
