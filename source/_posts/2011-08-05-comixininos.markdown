<h2> PayPal Problems </h2>

<a href="http://www.comixininos.com/index.php/">Comixininos</a> currently face problems with paypal as confirmations are not being sent through when payments are made. We are fixing this so that customers can clearly see when payments have gone through so that they are not confused at which step of the process they are on.

<h3> Football Fantasy In Spain </h3>
