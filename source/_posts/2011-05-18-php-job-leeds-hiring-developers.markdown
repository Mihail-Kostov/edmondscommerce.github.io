Just an update for any PHP developers in and around the Leeds, Bradford and West Yorkshire region:

Edmonds Commerce are still looking for skilled and enthusiastic PHP developers to join the team.

Our focus is entirely on e-commerce which is an exciting and challenging field for the right kind of person. 

We expect our developers to be at or around the Zend Certified Developer level but other than that there are no specific criteria.

If you are interested please do get in touch. 

We will initially ask you to do a quick PHP quiz, if you want to do that straight away just go here 

<a href="http://www.edmonds-commerce.co.uk/PHPTest/form.php">http://www.edmonds-commerce.co.uk/PHPTest/form.php</a>

Do <a href="/contact-us">get in touch directly</a> as well though, the spam bots quite enjoy filling it out as well and I haven't got around to protecting it.
