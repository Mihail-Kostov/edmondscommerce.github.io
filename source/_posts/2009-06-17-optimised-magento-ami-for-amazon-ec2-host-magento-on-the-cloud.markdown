Recently spoke to a client about the possiblity of setting up Magento on EC2 and remembered that I had seen a pre optimised AMI including caching etc to hopefully run Magento well.

A quick bit of Googling though and I saw that the top results are all people charging for  AMI's.

That can't be right, so I thought I would do a quick post to give the free optimsed AMI an SEO booster.
