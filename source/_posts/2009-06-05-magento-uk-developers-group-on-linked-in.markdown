I have decided to launch a <b>Magento UK Developers</b> group on Linked in. Mainly because we don't already have one and in that respect are lagging behind other countries like France. Of course that can't be right so I felt obliged to rectify the situation immediately.

You can see the all new <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?about=&gid=2006107&trk=anet_ug_grppro" target="_blank">Magento UK Developers</a> group on Linked.in right now.

I had to specify a web page, so for now this blog post will do pending something better.
