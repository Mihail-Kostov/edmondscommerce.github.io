<h3>PrestaShop Summary</h3>

PrestaShop is the second most popular open source shopping cart platform according to Google Trends as I write this article. Originally  founded in Paris in 2007 and with their first release in 2008, the platform has grown from strength to strength. They now have a second office in Miami USA and are pushing the platform aggressively so will no doubt grow in the future.

<h3>Headline PrestaShop Features</h3>

The PrestShop web site makes a big effort to emphasise the large number of features (275+ at time of writing) that are bundled with PrestaShop. Here is a highlight of some of the most interesting and important features that come with PrestaShop.

<h4>Multi Channel Out of the Box</h4>
Prestashop comes with Ebay Integration out of the box. This is quite unique in my experience though I do not doubt that with Magento being owned now by Ebay it won't be long before they have a similar out of the box solution. If you want to hook into other sales channels then there are affordable extensions available that will allow you to hook into other channels.

<h4>Bulk Data Handling</h4>
Prestashop ships with a fully featured bulk data import/export system that can handle products, categories, customers and more. This is a crucial feature to assist with migrations, bulk updates and possibly integrations with other systems.

<h4>Core Code Overrides</h4>
A bit like Magento, Prestashop features a core code override system that allows developers such as ourselves to modify the way core elements of Prestashop work without having to edit those core files. When you come to upgrade this will make things a lot easier and also makes it very clear what core functionality is being overridden which can then help enormously when reapplying those overrides to an upgraded store.

<h4>SEO Features</h4>
The SEO credentials of PrestaShop are really quite respectable with dedicated and customisable SEO URLs for each product and full meta information for all products and categories. PrestaShop also features both an auto generated HTML sitemap and a Google XML sitemap that Google and other search engines use to assist with fully spidering your site.

<h3>Demo PrestaShop</h3>
