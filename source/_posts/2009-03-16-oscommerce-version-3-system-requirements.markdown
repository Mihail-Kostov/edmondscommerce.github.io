Harald has released some info about the minimum requirements of osCommerce version 3 alpha on the osCommerce blog <a href="http://blogs.oscommerce.com/2009/03/16/minimum-requirements-for-oscommerce-online-merchant-v30-alpha-5/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

It requires PHP 5.2 as a minimum (though I would personally recommend avoiding version 5.2.0 and going for the latest version if at all possible.

The major reasons for this are the requirement for the object oriented mysqli interface for PHP and MySQL. It also requires PHP's JSON encode functions. 

JSON is a javascript data format a bit like XML or similar. It is used a lot of Web 2.0 style projects with a lot of asynchronous data transfers. 

This indicates that we can expect some nice Javascript based asynchronous tools that will hopefully be faster and easier to use than the current osCommerce.

osCommerce is without a doubt one of the most popular open source ecommerce platforms and it is going to be really interesting to see how this new version compares with Magento.

As a long time user, hacker and fan of osCommerce I really wish them all the best of luck.
