After loads of messing around I finally figured out that the Dojo Accordion container will only work if the id is alphanumeric and not if it is purely numeric.

I just wanted to make a note of that so that if I or anyone else hits this snag again, a quick Google search should bring up the solution :)

Now that the Zend Framework is shipping with tight integration with the Dojo Javascript framework, I have made it my mission to become a fully fledged front end Javascript developer as well as a server side PHP developer.

By using the power of PHP for the server side (with MySQL for Database duties) running on a Linux server and combining this with fully object oriented Javascript, I will be able to offer Rich Internet Application style applications. 

Or alternatively and more realistically, I will be able to make your web sites work better for you and your visitors, with intuitive interfaces and less reliance on page refreshes to handle interactions.
