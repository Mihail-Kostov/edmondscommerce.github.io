<h2>Aston's of London â€“ Magento Upgrade</h2>

Aston's of London required that their Magento site be upgraded from 1.3 CE to the latest version. This is required so that new functionality can be easily introduced on to the site when required.

<h3>Aston's of London</h3>

Aston's of London is an eCommerce company specialising in the sale of <a href="http://astonsoflondon.co.uk/">luxury jewellery, comfort items and gifts</a>.
