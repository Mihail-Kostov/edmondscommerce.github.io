Still learning some of the various things that can be done with Octopress and
came across this Octopress syntax highlighting package that makes it even nicer
to write blog posts (such as this one) using Vim.

You can see the package [here](https://github.com/tangledhelix/vim-octopress).

If you have already installed the SPF13 Vim then you are already running the required bundles
and can simply run

``` bash
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/tangledhelix/vim-octopress.git octopress
```

It isn't a groundbreaking improvement but it is worth throwing in there.
