If like me you love having the ability to grab the color hex code for any on screen element to use in your HTML or CSS then you have probably also come across the colorzilla firefox extension which allows you to do just that.

Unfortunately though it doesn't run on Firefox 3 / Ubuntu Intrepid 64 bit (for me anyway).

There are some hacks you can do to get it to work if you really want, but even better, you can install a little app called gcolor2 which offers you an OS level eyedropper tool so you can grab colors from any on screen element - sweet!

```

sudo aptitude install gcolor2

```

or use synaptic package manager to install if you prefer
