<a href="http://www.concrete5.org/">Concrete5</a> is a CMS system based on Zend Framework that uses Jquery for it's Javascript layer. Both of these are very popular and powerful frameworks that are really great to work with.

The thing that users really love though is the ability to edit Concrete5 pages on the fly making it very easy to use by non techies.

You can see the real ethos of the platform (from our techie point of view) <a href="http://www.concrete5.org/about/blog/client-work/an-open-letter-to-php-developers-about-concrete5/" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you are looking for some expert PHP developers to help you get your Concrete5 site off the ground then <a href="/contact-us">get in touch with Edmonds Commerce today</a>.
