Upholstered Headboards.co.uk specialises in manufacturing, supplying and distributing quality designer upholstered headboards to both the commercial and domestic markets.

We built this project from ground up. The website is based on Magento e-commerce platform. 

We implemented design for this website from PSD files sent to us by the client's designer. The implementation was quite fun as we had to utilize a variety of tools to get everything absolutely perfect.

The website supports multiple store (two at the moment with a view of increasing it to 5) with  a  single checkout. To get the both stores to channel all checkout transactions to one secure checkout URL was a bit of fun. We were forced to think out of the box to come up with a concrete and stable solution as Magento didn't support the requirements quite well.

We also implemented some nice custom select options to simply usability. Below is an example of a 
pop up select box displaying fabric options for user to select from.
