<h3>WordPress Summary</h3>

WordPress is probably one of the most successful open source packages of all time. Its beginnings can be traced back to a blogging platform called b2 that enjoyed some small success in the early 2000s. Wordpress was a fork of this package that went on to dominate the open source blogging platform market.

Since that time WordPress the platform has grown from a simple blog into a fully featured content management system (CMS) that now powers <a href="http://trends.builtwith.com/cms/WordPress" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">over 10% of the top million sites on the web</a>. 

Thanks to the huge range of freely available <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/" target="_blank">themes</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/" target="_blank">plugins</a> it is possible to use WordPress to power all kinds of sites.

In general we prefer to stick to its roots though and avoid using WordPress for things like e-commerce as we believe e-commerce sites should be powered by a proper e-commerce system such as <a href="/platforms/magento/">Magento</a> or <a href="/platforms/opencart">OpenCart</a>. For CMS and blogging services though we recommend WordPress nearly all of the time - it's a superb platform.

<h3>WordPress Headline Features</h3>

At it's core, WordPress is a blogging platform. Blogging is simply the process of writing articles that are displayed in descending chronological order on your web site, usually on the home page or on a sub page called something like "blog".

Modern WordPress is also a fully featured CMS system which means it supports pages nested in a hierarchical structure such as you can see on this site. In terms of content WordPress (perhaps with a few choice plugins) can support all kinds of content from standard text through to image galleries, videos and more.

WordPress comes as standard with a fully featured user commenting system with nested comments, moderation and editing.

The SEO and syndication features of WordPress (again with a few choice plugins) have made it the darling of SEO agencies across the globe. Things like ping and trackbacks made building link networks so easy it could be automated which gave big SEO gains. These days the benefit of these features has been reduced by the latest Google algorithm updates. Google continues to love WordPress sites though and WordPress and its themes present best practice HTML structures and combined with your well written and optimised articles the SEO potential is huge.
