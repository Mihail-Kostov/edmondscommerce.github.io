<h2>Magento redesign with added functionality</h2>

This project asked for new functionality to be added to an existing magento site, whilst modifying the design. The changes included modifying the layered navigation, the home page slide show and the layout of the category page. An SEO report was also produced for the site

<h2>Bent Shop</h2>

The Bent Gay Shop is the UK's <a href="http://shop.bent.com">premier gay sex shop</a>. With almost 2000 products on offer there is most certainly something for all gay men.

The project needed a lot of jQuery work to get the various different parts of the site working as they should. jQuery is a Javascript framework that makes implementing impressive effects and functionality a breeze. I really enjoyed working with it on this project.
