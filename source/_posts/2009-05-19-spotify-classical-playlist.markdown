I've been using spotify a lot recently. For coding work you can't beat a nice classical playlist, however I have found the classical collection of music on Spotify to be really quite hit and miss, with an unfortunate bias towards those tragic classical music meets 90's electronica abominations... :S

So I have started filtering out all the decent classical recordings that I find and storing them in <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/edmondscommerce/playlist/59TedVz8DyROHll7r7AgZT" rel="nofollow">this playlist</a>.
