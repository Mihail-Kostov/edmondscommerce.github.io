Sometimes it can be really hard to figure out exactly which file a chunk of code is coming from. At times like this the command line tool grep is immensely useful.

This snippet of code will search all php files within a specified folder. It will check through all files and sub folders for the string id="something"

```

find /path/to/root/search/folder/ -name "*.php" -print0 | xargs -0 grep 'id="something"'
```
