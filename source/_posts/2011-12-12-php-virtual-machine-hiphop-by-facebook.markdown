We told you about <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/php/php-into-compiled-c-hip-hop-by-facebook/">HipHop</a> a while back and we were pretty excited about it.

Now Facebook have decided to develop a virtual machine to allow dynamic translation and faster results than their previous interpreter based approach. This is paving the way for further performance improvements and ease of development.

You can read the full story <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150415177928920">here</a>.

We suspect it is still some way before this kind of thing will be more widely adopted but its certainly a good thing for PHP.
