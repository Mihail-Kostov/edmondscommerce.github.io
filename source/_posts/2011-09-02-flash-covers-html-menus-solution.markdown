If you've ever had that annoying problem where someone has asked you to put a flash banner on a site and it covers up your nice dropdown or pop-out menus, you'll be glad to know that the current versions of flash don't do that if you set the right parameter!  Yes that even includes flash on Linux browsers!

The parameter is called "wmode" and needs to be set to "transparent" for the z-index problem to go away.

Don't forget that search engines don't read the text in flash files so you don't want to use flash where you don't have to, but when a banner is required and is provided by a third party it's not always possible to avoid it.
