Widely regarded as best practice, the use of automated tests to ensure the correct functioning of your web application is a really powerful and useful practice.

For Magento it has historically been something that you would need to create yourself.

Now Magento have released a comprehensive package of 1000 tests that you can download as a package.

Based on Selenium the package will allow you to to test your store and will also assist with the creation of your own custom tests.

Another great development for Magento.
