I'm currently working on a project that has some really heavy javascript requirements. For the project I decided on using jQuery to implement the required functionality. Now having only used jQuery for a few days I have to say I'm impressed with how easy and intuitive it is.

That combined with the excellent jQuery support in Netbeans (my IDE of choice) is making this a real pleasure to work with :)
