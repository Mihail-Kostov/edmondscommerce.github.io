This is as much a note to self plus anyone else googling for the words <b>Ubuntu</b> <i>Jaunty</i> and <b>Filezilla</b>

The version that's in the repositories is a bit old and missing some cool features like synchronised browsing. 

The latest version is available from GetDeb - <a href="http://www.getdeb.net/app/FileZilla">http://www.getdeb.net/app/FileZilla</a>

If you have already installed a version from the repos, totally remove it using syntaptic package manager. Then download the main filezilla package and the filezilla-common package from GetDeb. Install the filezilla-common package first and then the Filezilla package itself.

Sorted.
