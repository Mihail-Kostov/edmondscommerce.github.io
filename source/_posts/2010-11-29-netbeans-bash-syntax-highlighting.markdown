The bash shell is awesome and scripting using a combination of PHP and Bash is a favourite technique of mine.

I want to be able to do it all in Netbeans but if you have the PHP flavour of Netbeans then its missing shell scripting support as standard. To get it to work easily, simply install the C/C++ plugin by going to Tools->Plugins->Available Plugins and ticking the C/C++ box.

It would be great if Netbeans would include bash scripting in with the PHP module so we can keep Netbeans as trim as possible, however this solution gives the desired result so I'm happy enough :)
