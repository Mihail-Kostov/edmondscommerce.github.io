Magento's product images come with a workable, although somewhat unusual image zoom functionality. But many users want a lightbox which lets users click an image and see a large version. Of course, you can use just about any jQuery plugin in your templates - <a href="http://www.magictoolbox.com/magiczoom/" target="_blank">Magic Zoom</a> being one such perfect example.

But instead of manually installing and configuring the Javascript yourself, <a href="http://www.magictoolbox.com/magiczoom/modules/magento/" target="_blank">MagicZoom has its own Magento MagicZoom extension</a> which can be dropped straight in and integrates beautifully with Magento

<h2>Some highlights MagicZoom's Magento extension</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Automatically inserts the product title onto the zoomed box</li>
	<li>Automatically linking main image and thumbnails for navigation when zoomed</li>
	<li>Visible on pretty much any area of the site, not just the product view page</li>
	<li>Per-theme customisation</li>
	<li>An insane amount of user-configurable options without touching a line of code (see below)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
MagicZoom's extension comes with its own installer, although for me it was perfectly sufficient to simply drop in the files
