<h1>Powerful Packages Without Cost</h1><br/><p>Edmonds Commerce are happy to help you to sort the wheat from the chaff and find the best combination of free and paid for software to give your company the power it needs at the minimum cost. The intelligent use of open source software has the potential to both save your organisation large sums of money on licensing fees, but also empowers your workforce with some of the most cutting edge software available today. <a href="../../contact-us/">Get in touch today</a> if you would like to discuss the tremendous opportunities of open source software and how they relate to you.</p><h2>The Cutting Edge</h2><p>  Thanks to the way that open source software is developed, it is much faster moving that some commercial software, with bug fixes and patches being released very quickly. Likewise new features and improvements are constantly being released meaning that open source software is not only a great option for now, but will remain to be in the future - which protects your investment into it.</p><h2>Open Source Web Technology</h2><p>If there is one area of computing that is undoubtably dominated by open source software then that is the realm of the web server. The role of a web server is relatively simple, our main requirements being that it is as fast as possible and stays running for as long as possible. Open source software, most usually a Linux operating system using Apache, fits this bill perfectly and enjoys the progressive development and excellent features of modern open source software.</p>
