Just stumbled across a simple and incredibly useful Netbeans plugin.

<a href="http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/676/path-tools">http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/676/path-tools</a>

Path Tools.

It's not listed in the standard list of available plugins, but if you download the nbm file and just drag and drop it into the plugin install dialog window it works easily enough.

Once installed you can right click any folder or file and explore in the OS file manager (Nautilus for example). You can also set up shell commands. From this point your imagination is your only restriction, this gives you easy integration to various external tools.

Nice :)
