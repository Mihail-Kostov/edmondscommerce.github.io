Traditionally Edmonds Commerce have always recommended Sage Pay as a payment service provider however recently the service has been a bit patchy and they have made some mistakes in their general strategy.

Its definitely a good time to evaluate the other available options and here are some that we recommend looking at:

<a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/extension/packages/module/5045/total_web_solutions_payment_gateway_module">Total Web Solutions</a>

<a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/Iridium%20Corporation/extension/3764/iridiumcorp_tpg">Iridium</a>

Both of these have free Magento connect extensions and offer competitive pricing and general feedback seems to be good so well worth taking a look at.

Edmonds Commerce have a close relationship with both companies and would be happy to help you get set up with them.
