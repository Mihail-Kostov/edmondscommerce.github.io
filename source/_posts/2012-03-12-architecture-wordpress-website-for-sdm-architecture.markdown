We have recently launched a clean, clear and simple web site for local architects <a href="http://www.sdmarchitecture.co.uk/">SDM architecture</a> who are based in Baildon near Shipley, Bradford and Leeds.

The brief was a clean web site that Stephen the owner can easily manage with his own content showcasing his work and attracting new clients.

All in all the project was a big success with a very rapid turnaround.

Stephen said 
"you have been very helpful and I have appreciated everything you have done for me".

here is a screenshot:
