Recently I setup a machine with Linux Mint.

One of the things that was I needed to install was an up to date version of Sun Java. However, for various reasons, this no longer appears in the official repos. 

Thankfully there is a different repo available here <a href="http://www.duinsoft.nl/packages.php?t=en" title="http://www.duinsoft.nl/packages.php?t=en" target="_blank">http://www.duinsoft.nl/packages.php?t=en</a> where you can download the latest version and ensure that it is updated
