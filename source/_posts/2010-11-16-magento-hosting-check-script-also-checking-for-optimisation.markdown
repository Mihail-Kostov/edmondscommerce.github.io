To try to help clients who are choosing a hosting platform for Magento, we have modified the already available Magento Check script and extended it to also check for optimisation and some other key requirements.

you can see the script here:

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://snipt.net/embed/cf6ca04739bafcd4834dc1b7bfd9b838"></script>

I'm using a snipt rather than pasting the code directly in so that if we update it in future, this post should always contain the latest version.
