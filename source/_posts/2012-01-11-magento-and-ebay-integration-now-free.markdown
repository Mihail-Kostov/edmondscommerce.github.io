Thanks to the acquisition of Magento by eBay, one of the major extension developers, Ess, now has an agreement with eBay/Magento to provide their integration extension free.

<a href="http://m2epro.ess-ua.com/">Here's their site</a> and <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/ebay-magento-integration-order-importing-and-stock-level-synchronization.html">here's the extension on Magento Connect</a>

It's also worth knowing that the extension is avaiable on Magento Go, so if you're looking for hosted-only, management-free eCommerce with integration with eBay, that might be an option.  Remember that Magento Go is not extendable by third parties though as it is a locked-down solution.

Anyway, some of the features of the extension are :-

- Stock Level Synchronisation between eBay and Magento Stores
- Create eBay listing templates which can create eBay listings direct from your Magento products
- Multiple eBay accounts per store
- Automatically leave feedback
- eBay transaction and order import
