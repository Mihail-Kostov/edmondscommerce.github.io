Google checkout has some exceptionally stringent requirements with regards to SSL which always seem to trip people up and involve lots of messing around getting the cert set up properly.

I have found a nice online cert checker which you can show to your hosting company (or whoever installed your cert) to show them that the cert isn't set up properly. 

You can find it here:
