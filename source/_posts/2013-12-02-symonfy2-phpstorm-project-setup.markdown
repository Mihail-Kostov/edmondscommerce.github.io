I was going to write a nice summary of how to set up PHPStorm with a Symfony2 project. 
There are a few things to be aware of such as getting the right code style set up so that your code follows the Symonfy2 coding standards.

As it happens though a quick google found that there is already an excellent summary [here](http://www.kevwebdev.com/blog/setting-up-a-symfony2-project-in-phpstorm.html) which I suggest you have a read of.

The only thing I would add to this are that you should probably install these PHPStorm plugins to get the best out of it:

[Symfony2](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin?pr=&pluginId=7219)

and [PHP Annotations](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7320)

If you do all of this then you should have a really nice PHPStorm set up for working on your Symfony2 projects, enjoy!
