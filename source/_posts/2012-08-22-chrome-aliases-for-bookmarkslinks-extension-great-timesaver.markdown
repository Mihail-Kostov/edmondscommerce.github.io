If you have a few URLS you are constantly going to and you would prefer a quick keyboard based way of going to them without having to type full URLs then this little extension could be for you.

The concept is very simple. You can create an alias word (eg phpmyadmin) which then redirects to your full phpmyadmin URL.

When you first install it you might set up some aliases and try to use them but get redirected to the google search results pages for that word instead. The extension author has worked around this behaviour by requiring you to put an "a ", the letter a followed by a space, before your alias.

Setting up the aliases is simple and I can already see this becoming one of my must have extensions.

Check it out for yourselves:
