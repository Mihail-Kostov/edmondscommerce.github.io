We are big believers in the power of blogs and regular blog posts to boost the SEO performance of sites. Especially ecommerce style sites that can sometimes struggle to get the kind of SEO focus that is required to rank at the top of the search engine results pages.

For this reason we have recently launched our new <b>SEO Blog Service</b>.

There are lots of options and we will tailor a package to suit your specific requirements and budget starting from Â£120 per month for a minimum of 6 months.

You will get high quality totally original blog stories written on the key themes, words and phrases that you want to promote. If you get us to install the blog for you, we will preconfigure it to get the maximum SEO benefit and will also link it up to a Twitter account so that you can push your message to the widest audience possible.

If you don't have a blog, or you have one but you never find the time or ideas to write quality blog stories - we really do receommend you give us a call to discuss this exciting proposal.
