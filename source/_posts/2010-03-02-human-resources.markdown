<h1>Staff Clocking and Holidays Systems</h1><br/><p>Your staff are likely to be one of the biggest costs to your <a href="../../marketing/business/" title="Information Explaining Business">Business</a> and it is imperative that you ensure you are getting the best from your staff. There are many aspects to this challenge and unfortunately we can not help you on all fronts. However what we can offer are clear and accurate systems for monitoring how many hours your staff are working and also automate administration of paid holidays etc.</p><h2>Hours and Pay</h2><p>A subsidiary of Edmonds Commerce, <a href="http://www.hours-and-pay.co.uk">hours-and-pay.co.uk</a> is an <a href="http://www.hours-and-pay.co.uk">online timesheet</a> system that allows your staff to clock on and off at the click of a mouse. This powerfully simple system encourages staff to only be clocked on when working. Combined with a move away from salary and onto hourly pay, it also offers carrot motivation with accurate tracking of hours worked in the month. This encourages staff to ensure that they are putting in the right amount of working hours to get the wage they are used to.</p><h2>Complete Control</h2><p>As the hours-and-pay.co.uk <a href="http://www.hours-and-pay.co.uk">online timesheet</a> system is entirely bespoke, we can customise it to your particular specifications including whatever special rules or requirements you need to handle the staff in your <a href="../../marketing/business/" title="Information Explaining Business">Business</a>. Furthermore, an easy to use online administration system makes payday gross wage calculations a breeze and easily lets you monitor the activities of all your staff from one location.</p><h2>Cost Effectiveness</h2><p>We have personally seen the huge impact on productivity and motivation in staff that this system brings. Much better and a lot cheaper than a real paper based clocking system and with potentially huge savings on your wage bill, we stand by this system as a "must have" for the small to medium sized enterprise.</p>
