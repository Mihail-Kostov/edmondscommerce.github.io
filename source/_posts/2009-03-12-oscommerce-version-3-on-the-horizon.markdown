Just checking out the osCommerce blog and it looks like there is some activity over at osCommerce in relation to version 3.

It would great to see osCommerce come back into the foreground of open source ecommerce!

After a brief look through the source code it looks like osCommerce is leaving its procedural routes behind but is still keeping some of the osCommerce code features such as the application top.

This could be an excellent compromise between OOP flexibility and procedural performance.
