Blind Express required that their customers be able to easily request free samples of their products. This required that a custom extension be created and integrated with the existing system.

Blind Express specialise in supplying made to measure and custom window <a href="http://www.blindexpress.co.uk">blinds</a>.

This project was a good challenge as the extension had to be integrated with previously existing custom product configuration.
