Recently the good folks at chrome have added a feature where you can reload without the cache, which is in a right-click on the reload button, but I was really confused as some machines seem to have it and others don't.

The key is whether developer tools is open or not! If you're using a recent version of chrome, press F12 to open the developer tools and then you can right-click the reload button, and you get three options - Reload, Hard Reload (redownloads images) and Empty Cache and Hard Reload.
