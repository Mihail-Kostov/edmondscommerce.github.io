Answer to this quite clear and simple question is:

unetbootin

Not the easiest to find but definitely one of the easiest solutions.

If you search for USB bootable drive generators mostly you will find windows apps.

Not too useful if you are already on Linux and simply want to try the latest version or perhaps an alternative distro on something that is going to give more useful performance than the traditional live CD.

<a href="http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/">uNetbootin</a> is a nice solid cross platform USB bootable Linux generator that will even handle the download of ISOs for you if required.
