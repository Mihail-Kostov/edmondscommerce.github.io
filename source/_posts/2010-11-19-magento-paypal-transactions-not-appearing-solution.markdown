If you are scratching your head trying to figure out why your paypal transactions are not showing up in your Magento admin despite everything being set up perfectly then this may well be your solution.

As recently discussed on the unofficial <a href="http://www.magento-forum.co.uk" title="magento forum">magento forum</a>, the paypal email address is <strong>case sensitive</strong>, so if the case on either paypal and Magento do not perfectly match then things won't work.

Double check the email address in both places and then ensure they match up.
