If you are constantly dealing with complex file structures and accessing various folders, the traditional "window for each folder" approach can quickly leave you with a cluttered work space and you may find your self taking time to find the right window.

For Ubuntu users, the PCMan file browser comes to the rescue with not only noticably faster file browsing but also firefox style tab support.

This is a real productivity enhancer and is an absolute pleasure to use.

You can download the easily installed deb package from here
