As internet applications get more and more complex and start to become more like desktop applications and less like electronic brochures, they can become more and more complex to test to ensure that everything is working properly.

There are numerous strategies to cope with this including the development of "test based" development, where tests are written at the same time, or even before, the actual code of the site is. This way, any changes to the codebase can quickly be checked for bugs by running the test suite.
