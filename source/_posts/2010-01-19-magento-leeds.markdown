Edmonds Commerce have been specialising in <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/">Magento</a> for a while now. We have been involved in numerous Magento sites doing things ranging from setting up entire stores (including multi store) through to developing custom Magento modules for specific client requirements.

If you are looking for a <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/blog/php/magento-uk/">Magento Developer</a> based in the UK, particularly the <strong>Leeds</strong> / <strong>Bradford</strong> area of <strong>West Yorkshire</strong> then definitely get in touch with us.

2010 has seen the full launch of our <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/blog/magento/magento-training-uk/"><strong>Magento Training Courses</strong></a> which are running in Leeds. The first was in early January and we now have two more dates lined up so if you are looking for Magento training then give us a buzz about that and we can give you all the details.

We think Magento is great and we are really happy to be helping more and more UK ecommerce businesses to migrate or establish themselves on this excellent open source ecommerce platform.
