Just wanted to say a quick "Happy Christmas" or "Seasons Greetings" for the more purist atheists or non Christians among you. Furthermore I would like to wish all readers a happy new year.

Despite the ongoing economic doom and gloom, I think there are plenty of reasons to be cheerful and do not doubt that with hard work and some judicious decision making, 2009 can be a successful year for ecommerce businesses across the globe.

So once again - <strong>Happy Christmas from Edmonds Commerce</strong>
