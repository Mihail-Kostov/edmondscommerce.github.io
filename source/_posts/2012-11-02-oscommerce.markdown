<h3>osCommerce Summary</h3>

The name <a href="http://www.oscommerce.com/" target="_blank">osCommerce</a> is derived from the combination of the words "open source commerce". osCommerce provides a fully featured platform for powering online shops including a front end with a complete checkout procedure and an administration side for with full management capabilites for customers, orders, products and categories.

There are a few forks of the core osCommerce package that provide more fully featured packages that combine the osCommerce core with some of the best extensions such as Easypopulate to give a full featured osCommerce package. Most notably those include <a href="http://www.zen-cart.com/" target="_blank">ZenCart</a> and CRELoaded - now <a href="http://www.loadedcommerce.com/index.php" target="_blank">LoadedCommerce</a>.

These days osCommerce is showing its age and it is no longer a platform that you should consider basing a new site build on. That is not to say that the platform has no value. There are a large number of merchants still using websites based upon osCommerce and often those sites are very highly customised and largely bespoke.

<h3>osCommerce History</h3>

Starting in the year <a href="http://www.oscommerce.com/about/news,1" target="_blank">2000</a> in Germany by Harald Ponce de Leon within a year the project was mature and within 2 years the project was being widely used. Version 2 became the really popular version and went through numerous releases and milestones.

osCommerce was the first open source e-commerce package and gave countless entrepreneurs a cost effective solution for establishing themselves as online retailers. At this time the internet was a very different place than it is now and the opportunties that osCommerce presented were ground breaking and exciting.

Unfortunately like many web site platforms there were some security issues with osCommerce and some of it's less well coded extensions that gave malicious hackers a back door to break into your server and cause problems. These were patchable but not everyone did that.

<h3>osCommerce Services</h3>

osCommerce is built using a procedural programming paradigm that has fallen out of favour these days with most projects moving towards and object oriented architecture. There are certain challenges with procedural programming however with the right approaches and skill level it is still possible to provide high quality secure and optimised code for your osCommerce site.
