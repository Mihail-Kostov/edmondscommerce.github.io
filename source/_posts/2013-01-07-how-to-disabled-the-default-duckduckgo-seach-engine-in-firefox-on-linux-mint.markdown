If you are using Firefox browser on Linux Mint you might have notice that the default search engine is not Google but DuckDuckGo.

DuckDuckGo are presenting themselves as the biggest threat to Google search engine bringing as the main advantage more privacy than what Google currently offer.

If you are happy with it than you are fine but if you feel like me that DuckDuckGo might have some interesting features, it does not bring the same result or way of using internet than Google search engine then you might want to come back to Google then please follow the below step by step procedure:

    Type about:config in the location bar and press Enter

    Type keyword.URL in filter

    Change the keyword.URL value to:

    http://www.google.co.uk/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q=

Hope that help.
