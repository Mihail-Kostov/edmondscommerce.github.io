If your host doesn't provide you with phpMyAdmin access, or if you simply want a faster lighter version of phpMyAdmin for simple DB admin tasks and running custom SQL queries, then take a look at <a href="http://phpminiadmin.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">phpMiniAdmin</a>. Its a single script so its incredibly easy to install - simply upload it.

I would be tempted to beef up the security a little bit, maybe put it into a htaccess password protected folder or something if you can. It has password functionality built in, but this doesn't seem to be working for me.
