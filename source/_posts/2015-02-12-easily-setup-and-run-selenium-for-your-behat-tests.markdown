description: "How to easily set up Selenium for your Behat testing"
---

We've decided on sticking with Selenium to run our Behat based testing as it allows us to do proper browser testing and it's also actually quite nice to be able to watch the tests as they progress and easily spot anything that might be wrong.

Getting Selenium running and ensuring everyone is using the same version is another challenge.

To make that easier, and also to allow us to easily update as we go, we have now released a Composer package so that it can easily be added to project dependencies.

For full details, we suggest you head over to the Repo and read the information there as that will be kept up to date.
