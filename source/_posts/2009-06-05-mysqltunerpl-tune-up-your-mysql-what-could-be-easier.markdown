Just came across this script today whilst evaluating a clients MySQL performance.

http://mysqltuner.pl

Its a perl script, just drop it in your home directory via SSH and run it to get some useful info regarding your MySQL configuration and any changes that you should make to improve performance.

I love stuff like this. No frills Just Works. Not even a real website - but a domain name that is also the name of the script. Extra kudos for that :-)<h4>More...</h4>
