If like me you miss the duplicate tab extension from Firefox 2, this little tip might cheer you up:

Hold down [ctrl] then drag and drop an open tab onto the green + (or any free tab bar space) and you will clone that tab.

Unfortunately this doesn't clone the history as well, so its not as good as the old duplicate tab, but at least it's something and its fast.

Found the tip <em><a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2007/12/firefox-3-to-feature-tab-duplication/">here</a></em>
