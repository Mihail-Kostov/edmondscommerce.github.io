It used to be Tabberwocky but that's died with FF4

I now recommend <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search/?q=tab+mix+plus&cat=all&x=0&y=0">Tab Mix Plus</a> which lets you achieve the holy grail, duplicate tabs!

Who would have though it was so hard.

Maybe FF5 will get some chrome like tab controls but for now this extension does a fair bit
