If you have a <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/" title="Magento Official Site" target="_blank">Magento</a> site then there are no doubt certain aspects of the maintainence and management of the web site that you would appreciate a little help with. This might range from things like upgrades down to one on one training and support in using the platform. If that sounds good to you then read on about our Magento support service.

Edmonds Commerce provide this kind of ongoing monthly support services to a number of clients. We work with you to get the most out of your store, assisting with things like getting it running as quickly as possible, updating plugins and investigating and fixing issues and bugs.

With a powerful and complex platform such as Magento, we find that this kind of wrap around support is really valuable to our clients so that they can ask us when things don't make sense and generally make sure they are doing things the best way to get the maximum advantage of the platform.

<h3>Magento Support Monthly Package</h3>

Monthly support packages include a discounted hourly rate for a set number of hours. We will agree with you a number of hours per month and will then schedule this in a way that suits your requirements. For some people a small number of hours every week is best. For others it makes more sense to have a chunk of time once a month with time in between to build up a list of requirements for the next batch.
