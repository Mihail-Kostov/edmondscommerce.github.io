<p>Looking for a fast and easy text entry system for Android?</p>
<p>I have recently been introduced to Swype as an alternative keyboard for Android. The system involves drawing a line between the letters you want to type as opposed to tapping each letter individually.</p>
<p>This is surprisingly intuitive and the speed possible is massively increased in comparison to the standard keyboard.</p>
<p>Currently freely available as a beta though you wouldn't know, feels perfectly ready for usage to me.</p>
<p>Check it out for yourself at https://beta.swype.com/android/get/</p>
