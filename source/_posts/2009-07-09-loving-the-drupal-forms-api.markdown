Working on a couple of custom Drupal modules at the moment and I have to say I'm really enjoying working with the Drupal forms API. I really feel like I have a wealth of cool features at my disposal without any particular effort or complication. It's a very logical system that does what it does really quite well.

If only the Zend Framework forms component was this easy to use!
