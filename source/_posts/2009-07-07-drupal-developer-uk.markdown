For content or community driven websites I definitely recommend taking a close look at the PHP based open source package <b>Drupal</b>. Like other successful open source packages, one of it's key strengths is in the tremendous breadth of additional modules that are available allowing you to create your custom mixture of features specific to your site requirements. 

A lot of very cool modules are available allowing you to put together a comprehensively fully featured site without requiring any real custom development work. Also applying a custom design to Drupal is really quite easy. For you this all means that Drupal represents a comparitively low cost option for a powerful, custom content based web site.
