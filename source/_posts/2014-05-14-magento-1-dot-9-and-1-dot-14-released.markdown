Magento has released the latest version of both CE and EE.

The big changes that are included are as follows

**Responsive design included as default**

Both editions now come with a responsive theme. This introduces jQuery, SASS, and Compass into native Magento and should allow for easier customisation in the future.

**Bill Me Later**

The PayPal integration has been upgraded to include the [Bill Me Later](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/promotional-financing) financing option. This allows customer to pay for products over six months whilst the merchant gets paid straight away.

**Other security fix and performance fixes**

The full list of changes can be seen [here](http://www.magentocommerce.com/knowledge-base/entry/new-features-ce19-ee114)
