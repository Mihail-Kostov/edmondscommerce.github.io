Virtualbox is an amazing tool for testing and developing on various systems.

Now it's even easier as there is a nicely organised repository of clean VirtualBox images you can download and get running with in a matter of minutes.

<a href="http://virtualboxes.org/">http://virtualboxes.org/</a>

We are going to use them for some <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk">Magento</a> performance optimisation testing on various platforms as we perfect our <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/magento/magento-optimised-hosting/">Magento Server Optimisation</a> skills and try to benchmark some new ideas.
