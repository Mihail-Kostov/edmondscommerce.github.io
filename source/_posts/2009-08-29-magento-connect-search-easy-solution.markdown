The Magento site has recently switched from serving search results internally to using Google to provide the results. Whilst the Google results pages are a lot faster, we now miss the opportunity to search specific areas of the Magento site.

In particular, its now a bit of a pain to track down a suitable module in Magento Connect. To make things a bit easier I have knocked together a simple <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/stuff/magento-connect-search.html">Magento Connect Search</a> tool.

I could easily extend this tool to provide searching of other areas of the Magento site if you wish. Just drop a quick comment against this blog post and I will do it.
