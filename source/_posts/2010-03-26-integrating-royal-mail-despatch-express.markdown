If you are struggling to understand the Batch Import file layout from the exceptionally sparse details supplied in the "Getting Started" document's Appendix B which supposedly details the file layout, then this is the solution you need. 

It looks very much like there are simply some pages missing from this document. There is another document called "<a href="ftp://ftp.royalmail.com/Downloads/public/ctf/rm/Despatch_Express_Interfacing_System.pdf">Interfacing With Your System</a>" which has these missing pages.

You won't get anywhere without it!
