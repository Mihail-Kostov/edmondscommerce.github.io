<h1>Achieve Excellent Service with Greater Efficiency</h1><br/><p>Ecommerce technologies offer an excellent opportunity to offer the highest level of customer services with greater efficiency than you can dream possible. By utilising email as a primary communications platform, we can let software help us to deal with customer services tasks quickly or even automatically.</p><h2>Great Service</h2><p>We have found that pro active outbound customer services systems that keep your customers informed at every step of the way do wonders for your customer satisfaction levels. There is still a lot of uncertainty around shopping online and many customers may be relative newcomers to the idea, nervous about dealing online. Regular contact that keeps them fully informed and reassures them that you are dealing with their order in a prompt and professional manner makes your customers feel much more secure when dealing with you.</p><h2>Greater Efficiency</h2><p>With a bit of thought and investment, it is possible to build semi automatic and automatic customer services processes which will keep your customers fully up to date at all times with specific information about their order. This outbound email based information will keep your customers happy that the order is being processed, and will also give them the information that they might otherwise decide to call up and ask instead.</p><h2>Outbound not Inbound, Proactive not Reactive</h2><p>If you contact your customer before they contact you, this gives immediate customer satisfaction as you are making the ordering process that much easier by reducing the effort involved for your customers. By reducing the number of inbound calls and emails, a good proactive customer services system can reap huge efficiencies in staff time required to maintain customer services whilst maintaining an impeccably high standard of service. Furthermore, this reduction in inbound order enquiries gives your team more time to deal with potential sales, or more complex customer services enquiries.</p>
