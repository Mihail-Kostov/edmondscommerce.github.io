Followers of this blog will remember the <a title="Replicate Netbeans “Select in project” in phpstorm" href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/phpstorm/replicate-netbeans-select-in-project-in-phpstorm/">Replicate Netbeans “Select in project” in phpstorm</a> post which gave a handy key combo to select the current file in the project window.

It has been brought to our attention that there's also a button to do this with the mouse in one click!  At the top of the Project window, there's a cross-hair/target icon labelled a rather cryptic "Scroll from Source".  Click that and it does what netbeans users will be looking for as "Select in Projects"

So there you have it, "Scroll from Source", is the magic words that you want.
