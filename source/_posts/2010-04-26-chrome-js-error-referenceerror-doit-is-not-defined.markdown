If you are scratching your head trying to figure out where in your Javascript the mysterious doIt error is coming from when testing using Chrome, this might just save you..

After loads of digging around it turns out that the error is actually caused by the Chrome SEO extension I had installed.

Disable that and the error goes away, so it was never your fault in the first place!!
