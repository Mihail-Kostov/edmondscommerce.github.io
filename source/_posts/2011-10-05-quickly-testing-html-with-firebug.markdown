Ever need to quickly test some HTML that you copied from some where?

If you have Firebug installed, you can open a new tab, go the the HTML tab in Firebug, click edit and paste your HTML and Firefox will render it. This is faster than having to open a text editor, paste the contents and save the file, but JavaScript on load events won't fire.
