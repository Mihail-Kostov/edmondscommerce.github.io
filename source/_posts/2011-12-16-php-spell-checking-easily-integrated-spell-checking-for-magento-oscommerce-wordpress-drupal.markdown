If you would like your users to be able to spell check their text before they send it and need something more than the browser based spell checking then this could be of interest.

Recently came across this and it looks very impressive:

<a href="http://www.phpspellcheck.com/">http://www.phpspellcheck.com/</a>

There is a commercial licence for $89 which is a reasonable price I think.

You can download the package and integrate it for free though so you don't need to buy the licence until you decide to deploy it to a commercial site.
