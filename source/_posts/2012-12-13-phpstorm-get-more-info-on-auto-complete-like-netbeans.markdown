All developers love code completion, but sometimes the minimalist info that can come up in PHPStorm can be not quite enough.

Netbeans gave an excerpt that gave plenty of information from the docblock, and PHPStorm can do too, it just defaults to off.

The setting is under Editor->Code Completion and is "Show full signatures".  The good news is it is an "IDE Setting" so it persists for all projects, the bad news is that that means the setting will be forgotten about before you next reinstall and want it again.
