If you regularly swap between a PC (Ubuntu for me) and a Mac, then this little tip might just save you a load of hassle.

The biggest bug bear switching between the two systems is that the combinations [ctrl]+[c] etc are now [cmd]+[c] which is not on the same keyboard locaation and is generally a bit more fiddly to use, especially if you have spent a lifetime using [ctrl].

Open the System Preferences and select Keyboard & Mouse under the hardware section. Click on Keyboard tab. Next press the Modifier Keys button located at the bottom left. Now swap the Control and Commands keys. 

That's it, feels like a proper computer now :)
