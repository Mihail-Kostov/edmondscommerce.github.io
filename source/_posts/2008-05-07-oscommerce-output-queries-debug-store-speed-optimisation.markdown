A common requirement for oscommerce store owners is to try to get pages loading faster.

Part of the problem is that each oscommerce install is different, with a mixture of contributions and bespoke customisations all making their own database queries and causing their own problems. The first part of the solution is to actually be able to see what is going on. For this you need to install the <a href="http://www.oscommerce.com/community/contributions,2575" rel="nofollow">Output Queries Debug</a> contribution for osCommerce.

After that, it is really down to looking through the debug information and tracking down the errant code or SQL and trying to tidy it up.

This is something we specialise in, if you need any help getting your oscommerce store up to speed, simply get in touch.
