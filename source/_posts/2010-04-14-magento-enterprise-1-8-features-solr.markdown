Very interesting to read about the latest Magento Enterprise version release. Among other things, they have implemented <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a> for searching. Solr is what can only be called a "proper search engine" and is the alternative to searching a database which is the usual way the Magento search works.

By using a proper search engine, the site will be able to display better, more relevant results a lot faster than is possible with the database driven method. The main downside is that its complex to set up.

It will be interesting to see if a paid or community extension becomes available to provide Solr to community edition users.

There is a Google Code project, but it seems to be dead in the water:
