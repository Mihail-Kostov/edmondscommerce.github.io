<h1>Fully Online Order Processing Systems</h1><br/><p>Ecommerce is very much about offering a product catalogue and then allowing people to place and pay for an order online. Once this order has been placed then it is down to your <a href="../../marketing/business/" title="Information Explaining Business">Business</a>es internal order processing system to progress the order through the various stages and finally to despatch. Of course there may well be post despatch problems etc which you will also need to be able to handle</p><h2>Easy Audit Trail</h2><p>A full centralised and online order processing system allows for an extremely easy audit trail. With a single order number, you can see the entire history of an order including all the decisions and communications that were made along the way. This makes things easier for your customer services staff which then means a much better experience for your customers.</p><h2>Every Step of the Way</h2><p>By utilising a well designed order processing system it is entirely possible to handle every single step of the order processing chain in the same online system. This means that your customer services representatives will be dealing with the exact same system as your warehouse operatives. Managers can easily keep track and monitor the activities of their teams. You can keep an eye on the overall operation from anywhere in the world!</p>
