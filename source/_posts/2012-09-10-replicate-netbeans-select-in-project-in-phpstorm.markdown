Netbeans has a handy feature when you right-click a file in the editor window to take you to the file in the project (file manager tab) view.

To get phpstorm to do this is not as simple but is handily mappable to a shortcut key.

To enable this, go to Settings->Keymap->Main menu->Navigate->Select in... and choose a key.  I set it to Alt+P, so now I press Alt+P then press enter to go to the current file in the project view.
