Like a pheonix rising from the ashes, Demonoid - one of the most highly regarded torrent trackers on the internet has returned after being shut down back in November 2007.

For anyone that was a member of Demonoid, this is amazing news as it truly was/is one of those resources that once you have had it, you feel like you can not live without it.

So well done to the people behind demonoid, may it continue to be the premier site for finding all of the torrents you need.

After a rollercoaster ride of ups and downs responding to pressure from the dutch and then (after a quick relocation) the canadian authorities the site was taken down completely in November 2007.

Now the site has returned, albeit with a new web master as Deimos has stood down from administering the site. 

Hopefully Demonoid is here to stay this time. You can't keep a good web site down!
