<strong>To find out about our Magento Training - please <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/contact-about-magento-training.html">Get in Touch</a></strong>

Edmonds Commerce are pleased to announce our new venture in offering professional training on the Magento open source ecommerce platform. We are firm believers in the Magento platform, but we realise that for many new or even established businesses running on Magento, the system can seem a bit daunting. 

There are so many great features built into Magento as standard that it really does make sense to make sure you are utilising them all to their fullest potential. This is why we have established this training programme - to help ecommerce business owners and their staff learn how to use Magento to the fullest.

To deliver the course, we have partnered up with <a href="http://www.ntileeds.co.uk/">NTI</a> who are based in Leeds City Centre. It has great accessibility from all parts of the country thanks to excellent road, rail and air connections.

At the moment we are still discussing the final details for the course and are definitely interested in hearing what you the public would like to see on that course. If you have any comments or would like to register your interest please get in touch about <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/contact-about-magento-training-uk.html">Magento Training UK</a>
