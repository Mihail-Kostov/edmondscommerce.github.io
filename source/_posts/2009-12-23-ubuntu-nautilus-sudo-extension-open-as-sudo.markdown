If you use nautilus to manage your files (if you are using Ubuntu, you do) and you would like a quick way to open files with sudo rights, check out the nautilus-gksu package. 

This extends nautilus allowing you "open as administrator" from a right click menu. This is a great time saver and a much better idea than trying to run nautilus itself as root.
