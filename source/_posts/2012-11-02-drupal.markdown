<h3>Drupal Summary</h3>

<a href="http://drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a> is a very popular content management system or framework that is very well suited to more complex and larger content driven web sites. It is possible to use Drupal for all kinds of sites ranging from blogging through to e-commerce however we prefer to use more specialised platforms such as <a href="/platforms/wordpress">WordPress</a> and <a href="/platforms/magento">Magento</a> for those kinds of sites respectively.

Drupal consists of a core framework which handles the core functionality and on its own is enough to power a brochure site, blog or web 2.0 style user content driven site or forum. Where Drupal comes into it's own though is with the use of community contributed modules to extend the Drupal core and provide for all kinds of other functionality.

As mentioned there are e-commerce contrib modules for Drupal however we would always recommend using a fully dedicated e-commerce package such as <a href="/platforms/magento">Magento</a> or <a href="/platforms/prestashop">Prestashop</a> for an e-commerce focused web site. We would only really consider using a Drupal ecommerce module for very light e-commerce requirements.

<h3>Headline Drupal Features</h3>

Drupal differentiates itself from more lightweight CMS systems with features like multiple users with user profiles and more complex content types including polls and forums. The focus is not just on admin generated content but also more community and user based content meaning that Drupal is an excellent choice for any kind of community portal.

The real magic of Drupal comes from the modular nature of the system, it really is more of a framework than an application. If you want to know what Drupal can really do then you need to look at the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/Modules" target="_blank">Drupal modules</a>

<h3>Drupal Distributions</h3>

If you do not relish the idea of installing a sequence of modules to the Drupal core to get what you need, you may find that there is an existing <a href="http://drupal.org/project/distributions?solrsort=iss_project_release_usage%20desc" target="_blank">Drupal Distribution</a> that provides all or most of what you need. These distributions are pre-packaged collections of Drupal Core plus some relevant modules to give you a particular flavour of Drupal.

The most popular distribution is <a href="http://drupal.org/project/commerce_kickstart" target="_blank">Commerce Kickstart</a> though as we mentioned we would recommend dedicated e-commerce packages such as <a href="/platforms/magento/">Magento</a> for this kind of site.

By looking at the distributions you can get a good feel for the kinds of sites Drupal is great for. Distrubutions such as <a href="http://openpublicapp.com/" target="_blank">OpenPublic</a> which are designed for specific requirements and audiences. OpenPublic focusses on things like security and accessibility to ensure that your site is going to meet the stringent requirements of a government web site. The fact that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is using this distribution underlines the public sector and enterprise readiness of this kind of platform.

Distributions we think you should check out include:
