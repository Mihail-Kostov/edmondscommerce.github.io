So there is often a requirement for sharing files but what happens if those files are files that absolutely must be secure, like private ssh keys?

Well Dropbox whilst a good product is third-party and not encrypted so if there's an exploit, the contents of the files could well be exposed to people you don't want.

Enter Wuala, a service by Lacie.  Similar to Dropbox in many ways, but differing in that the files are encrypted locally, so if you loose your password, the files will be inaccessible, permanently.  Believe it or not, that's a really good thing!

Oh, and there's a client for Linux, Mac, Windows and Mobile (Android and iPhone).
