<h1>Reinvented Inventory Management</h1><br/><p>A <a href="../../marketing/business/" title="Information Explaining Business">Business</a> needs to know what it has in stock so that stock levels can be maintained and customers can have an idea of turnaround time when placing an order. An inventory management system that relies extensively on human input is highly liable to be inaccurate. A software driven online system can achieve much greater accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, by being online, real time stock information is available to you and all your employees all of the time meaning better management decisions and better customer services.</p><h2>Automatic Updating</h2><p>To some it may be an obvious thing, but it is easy to create a system that automatically reserves in stock items when a customer orders them, and automatically takes them out of stock when the order is despatched. This is one of the most common transactions your stock system should have to deal with. By doing it automatically you are ensuring that it is always done accurately.</p><h2>Accurate Reporting</h2><p>Accurate real time stock information is so valuable at every step of the <a href="../../ecommerce/" title="Information Explaining Ecommerce">Ecommerce</a> process that is hard to overstate. Build into that a zoning system so that the stock system can also tell your warehouse operatives on exactly which shelf the item is located and you have an incredibly useful and efficient stock control and inventory management system.</p>
