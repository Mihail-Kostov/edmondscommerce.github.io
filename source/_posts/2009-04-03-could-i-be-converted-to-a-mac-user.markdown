Perhaps it's the 30" monitor that is seducing me, or the cute way windows can pop open and closed. Maybe it's the fact that as a Linux user I see a lot of things that I recognise thanks to OSX being a unix based OS.

Now that I have my Ubuntu Jaunty laptop and the Macs talking to each other I can use my laptop as a mobile web server and the Mac as my internet browsing and now that I am setting up some IDE's, possibly even my coding station.

On the downside though I am stuggling with the lack of right click, the US keyboard layout with the " and @ switched round and the cramped [apple]+[c], [apple]+[v] copy and paste.

Still its interesting to finally get to play around on a Mac after hearing and reading all the hype and the almost evangelical Mac users. I have to admit they do have a point - its very slick.

I do love Ubuntu though, and Jaunty has proved an even nicer refinement of an already awesome OS. Plus the fact that I can run Ubuntu on commodity hardware and expect excellent performance, security and stability as standard.

I suspect (though I haven't done the sums) that value for money wise a Ubuntu based system will give me more for the same price when compared to a Mac. They aint cheap and that's for sure!
