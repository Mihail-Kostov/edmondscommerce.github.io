If you use Calibre to manage your ebooks and ereading device, then this might be of interest.

Calibre is an excellent open source ebook management system, however some elements of its configuration are a little complex.

If you want to save books in a custom folder structure then its easy (and very powerful) with liberal use of regex or regex like patterns.

For reference, here is my send to devices save template:
