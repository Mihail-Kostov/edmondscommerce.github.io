Highly customisable and extendible, an osCommerce store can handle huge volumes of visitors.

Edmonds Commerce are happy to help you install and configure existing contributions and can easily create a contribution for you if there is not an existing one to suit.</p><h2>Performance osCommerce</h2><p>Due to the way that osCommerce was created, its performance can degrade quite badly on higher traffic sites, especially if you have a large product catalogue.
