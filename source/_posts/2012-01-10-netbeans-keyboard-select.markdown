I recently installed the latest version of Netbeans (7.1) and decided to have a look through the available plugins at the same time. In there I found one called Quick File Chooser.

This replaces the file selector with a keyboard optimised version, which includes auto-complete and narrowing down a file list as you type.

If you prefer the keyboard over the mouse this is a required extension!
