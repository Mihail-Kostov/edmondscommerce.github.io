One of the things I quite liked on OSX is the easy ability to force an errant program to quit. In OSX the force quit menu is easily accessible from the apple menu in the top left.

On Ubuntu I was hoping there would be a similar solution and although it is not enabled by default, there is.

Simply go to the top panel (bar) and right click then select "add to panel".

In this menu there is a button called "Force Quit". If you select this, you will have a new button on your top panel with a picture of a broken computer window. Clicking on this button will then give you a new mouse pointer. Any window that you click on with this mouse pointer will be forcibly closed.

I think that's even slicker than the OSX way :-)
