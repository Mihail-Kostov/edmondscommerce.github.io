<h2>Welcome to the Mobile Age</h2>
Mobile internet devices and smart phones are becoming more and more a part of our every day life.

<h2>Here are some undisputed facts:</h2>

<b>1.</b> Smart phone use is increasing exponentially.
<b>2.</b> Mobile internet is becoming faster and more accessible all the time.
<b>3.</b> Customer expectations for their mobile online experience are increasing.
<b>4.</b> Your company needs to keep up with this trend.

<h3>Mobile Optimised Version</h3>
If you are looking to develop your exisiting web site or create a new web site then a mobile optimised version of your site should definitely be part of your plan. There is a lot of hype surrounding app development which has its place but the first thing you need to ensure is that casual mobile visitors to your site have an enjoyable and optimised experience that encourages them to convert and also to come again.

<h3>What Does Mobile Optimised Mean?</h3>
It is not rocket science. Mobile optimisation generally means having a version of your site that is designed to be easy to read on a smaller screen, with clear controls that are easy to operate via a touch screen. As opposed to mobile app development, which is where you create a custom programme to interact with your service that the user has to download and install, a mobile optimised web site is simply a web site that the user can visit and interact with instantly. The key is that the design of the site is optimised to work well on a smaller touch screen device.

Great examples of mobile optimised sites include those of Amazon, Marks and Spencers and the BBC.

A key component of offering a mobile optimised site is device detection and automatic redirection to the mobile version. Ideally this should be totally transparent without any user intervention required at all.

Of course, all of this must be done without risking or compromising your SEO strategy in any way.

<h3>Mobile Optimisation, Hard?</h3>
This might sound quite complex and in a way it is, but this is something that we can help you with. We offer mobile version as standard with any new site build proposal. We are also happy to create a mobile optimised version to go alongside your current site.
