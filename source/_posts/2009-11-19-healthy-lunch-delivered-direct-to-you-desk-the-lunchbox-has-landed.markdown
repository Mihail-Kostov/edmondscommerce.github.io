<a href="http://www.thelunchboxhaslanded.com/offices/index.php">The Lunchbox Has Landed</a> is all about <a href="http://www.thelunchboxhaslanded.com/offices/goodreasons.html">healthy options</a> and convenience and pretty good value as well. No more queueing up at the supermarket for sweaty sandwiches and a packet of crisps. Instead get your lunch delivered direct to your desk so that you can enjoy the full length of your lunch break to relax. Alternatively for you focussed workaholics to gain an extra productive half an hour of the day with no compromise on your nutrition.

Edmonds Commerce have taken care of the technical development of The Lunchbox has Landed. The project's main requirement was a<a href="http://www.thelunchboxhaslanded.com/offices/samplemenu.html"> user friendly and intuitive ordering system</a> allowing you to easily build up your personal selection of lunchbox ingredients and schedule your lunches in advance. 

The project uses large amounts of Jquery for the Javascript, and a bespoke object oriented PHP framework for the business logic. The visual design has been taken care of by <a href="http://www.designermagic.co.uk/">Designermagic</a> who have worked closely with Edmonds Commerce to achieve the final cohesive, effective and intuitive result.

<blockquote>
