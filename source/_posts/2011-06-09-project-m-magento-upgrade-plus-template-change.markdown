We have recently finished a nice Magento upgrade project for our client Project M who is based in Australia. ProjectM specializes in selling computer accessories and also computer games.

This particular project involved upgrading the site to the latest Magento (v1.5.1.0) from version 1.3.1.1 and also to install a new template while ensuring all important features from the previous template remained functional.

We also worked on upgrading/fixing old extensions plus installing new ones as per requirement.

Despite challenges especially from the size of the database the project was nice to work on. To view the entire site please click here to <a href='http://www.projectm.com.au/'>visit ProjectM</a>
