description: "Block annoying sounds from Chrome"

You might not be aware that in Gnome Shell and likely anything else using Linux you can easily block sound from entire applications.

For me this means blocking annoying auto playing videos with sound that are cropping up as I'm trying to listen to some nice tunes whilst I work.

To block the sound is very easy, simply go to the sound control panel which in Gnome Shell is access via the top right panel. 

Once into the sound section, go to the right most tab where you can control sounds on an application by application basis. Simply turn off the annoying onces.

Beautiful :)
