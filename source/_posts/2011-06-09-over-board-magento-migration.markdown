<h2>Over Board â€“ Migration to Magento from OSCommerce</h2>

Over Board wished to move away from OSCommerce due to limitations encountered while using OSCommerce. Using Magento allows the company the flexibility they desired. This project involved implementing a new site design as well as importing data from the old OSCommerce site.

<h3>Over Board</h3>

Over Board are an eCommerce company specialising in the sales of <a href="http://www.over-board.co.uk/">water proof device cases and bags</a>.

This project was terrific as it demonstrates the ability to move away from a relativity old system to a new system and at the same time enabling a lot more functionality and flexibility.
