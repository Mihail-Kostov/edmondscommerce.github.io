Its been rumoured for ages but its finally happened, Yahoo and Microsoft have tied together and obviously the goal is to combine their forces to take on Google.


<blockquote>"Through this agreement with Yahoo, we will create more innovation in search, better value for advertisers, and real consumer choice in a market currently dominated by a single company,"</blockquote>

Said Steve Ballmer, head of Microsoft.
