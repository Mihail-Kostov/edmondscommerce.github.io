If you are a windows user, you may be familiar with the Beyond Compare programme which is used to compare two text files. This can be an invaluable tool when you are debugging or tracking changes as it highlights for you any differences between two text files.

For Ubuntu, there is an excellent programme called Meld which offers the same functionality and works very well. You can download and install it easily using the Add/Remove tool in your applications menu.

You can read all about Meld <a href="http://meld.sourceforge.net/">here</a>

Another great open source linux package!
