Today I got a notification through that Magento 1.8 had finally been released.

This has been in beta since alpha since April, and contains server fixes that a lot of people have been waiting for.

The most important one for UK vendors is that the rounding issue in tax calculations has been fixed.

There are also improvements to caching and database performance. The full release notes can be seen <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/knowledge-base/entry/ce-18-later-release-notes">here</a>

These are issues that have affected merchants since that change in the VAT rate, so we would recommend upgrading for everyone at this time.
