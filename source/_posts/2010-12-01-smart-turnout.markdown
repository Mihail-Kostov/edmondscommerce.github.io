Smart turnout are a UK based company specializing in smart dresses. The project involved re-designing their current Magento-based website and create a tool that will anable them to change site design easily and as of when they want to. It was a fun project to work on and one that made us think out of the box! 

Apart from implementing the new design from the PSD file, the tool we created provides them the flexibility to easily customize the feel and look of the site anytime they want without any technical expertise. No more installing season specific design templates anymore, one design fits all seasons was the motto!
