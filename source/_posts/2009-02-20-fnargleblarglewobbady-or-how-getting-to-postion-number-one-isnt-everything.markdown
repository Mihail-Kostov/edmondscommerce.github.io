On a forum I frequent the discussion came up of guaranteed number one positions in Google.

My argument here is that its easy enough to get to position number one for "something"  - for example <b>Fnargleblarglewobbady</b>

The question is whether the search keyword or phrase is one that there is any worth in being number one for. That all boils down to how often it gets searched for. I am guessing that this post will get to number one for Fnargleblarglewobbady as no one has searched for it.
