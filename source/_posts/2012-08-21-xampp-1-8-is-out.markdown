A new version of Xampp has been release which includes PHP 5.4! Remember that instantly jumping to the latest version of PHP is not necessarily a good idea as numerous deprecated features may have been removed and others may now be deprecated and cause issues in your applications. Check the PHP 5.4 release announcement for the major changes: http://php.net/releases/5_4_0.php

The Xampp 1.8 release also includes numerous other updates including phpMyAdmin, MySQL and many more of the applications bundled with it.
