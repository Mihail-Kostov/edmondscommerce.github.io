<h2>Magento Experts UK</h2>
Magento is now our recommended e-commerce platform in nearly every situation. The range of features, functionality and stability offered by Magento eclipses every other e-commerce platform we have looked at. The fact that the Community Edition is totally free, despite having basically all the functionality of the Professional and Enterprise versions that cost thousands per year, just underlines that.

Varien, the company behind Magento have adopted a tried and tested open source business model which unleashes the source code to the public and instead of trying to hold onto the source, instead they openly encourage the open source community to adopt, extend and improve the code and extensions. 

<h3>Suitable for All Kinds of Business</h3>
The massive flexibility of the Magento platform means that it can fit all kinds of business models and requirements from traditional business to consumer (B2C), wholesaling business to business (B2B) and even the sale of services and custom manufactured products such as printing etc.

<h3>Integrate with Other Systems</h3>
From the ground up Magento is designed to work together with other systems to become part of a full business platform. The built in API allows us to create custom integrations for practically any requirement. For the more common integrations there is generally already an extension available, either free or commercial, which will accomodate the requirement.

<h3>Amazingly Flexible Modern Design</h3>
Magento sites tend to naturally look great with modern look and feel. The design system in Magento gives incredible freedom to designers to create a visual style that is totally unencumbered with the usual constraints of an ecommerce package. Magento sites range massively in terms of their design. For those on a budget there is a great and ever increasing range of free and commercial themes that can be bought for as little as $80 USD and installed with ease to give your site a great look. For larger clients we are able to make Magento look and feel exactly as you desire, with a contemporary design that is clean and clear and offers your customers and sleek and simple interface for purchasing your products.
