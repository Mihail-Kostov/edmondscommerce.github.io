One of the things that often frustrates those who have used Photoshop in the past often complain about the switch to Linux and the GIMP specifically is the lack of groupable layers.

There is a plugin that does provide this functionality, albeit in a rather unintuitive manner :-

It's called LayerGroups and is at <a href="http://registry.gimp.org/node/16563" title="http://registry.gimp.org/node/16563">http://registry.gimp.org/node/16563</a>

This is a really useful feature and really does need an overhaul on the usability stakes but might be useful if you are moving to Linux from Windows.
