We recently decided to give Google Apps a try, mainly due to the requirement for some decent webmail and it being a brilliant webmail system at the unbeatable price of free.

Here is my quick guide to migrating easily:

Migrating emails - sign up to the free trial of the premier edition and use the IMAP migration system. It is by far the slickest option and will faithfully and accurately import all of your emails across. Best, you can set it going and then shut down your local machine, its all handled server side, so no requirement to shunt emails up from your desktop or anything like that.

Nested Folders - if you do the above and have a lot of nested folders, you will notice a pretty ugly massive list of tags with forward slashes in. To get back your nested sub folder like functionality you need to go to settings, then labs and then enabled the nested tags extension. This will give you a sub folder like interface for your tags and tidy the whole thing up.

Turn off those adds at the top - If you notice adds being displayed at the top and would like to get rid, its easy - Gmail calls them web clips and you can turn them off in the settings.
