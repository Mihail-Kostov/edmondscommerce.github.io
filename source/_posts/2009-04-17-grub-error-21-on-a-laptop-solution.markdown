If you ever get Grub Error 21 when trying to boot your Linux laptop or notebook then this post is for you.

Grub Error 21 means that it cannot find the hard disk. On a desktop machine this probably means that you need to fix Grub itself. Just google for Grub error 21 or supergrub.

However on laptops I seem to suffer this problem on a regular basis. The problem is that the hard drives are not firmly attached and can become dislodged. 

To fix it just open up your laptop HD enclosure and make sure it's firmly attached. I also like to roll up a bit of paper and wedge it in there so that it can't slide out again in future.

Hope this helps out someone else :-)
