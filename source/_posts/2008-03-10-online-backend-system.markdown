What could be more convenient than having all of your business systems integrated into one online package. No more hassles moving information from online to offline systems. No more out of date or vague information regarding stock figures or supplier invoices.

For an online business with a well specified and rigorously backed up dedicated server, it makes a lot of sense to move away from applications that run on the desktop to applications that run on the server. For your employees to interact with your business systems, they only need a broadband internet connection and a web browser. This in turn opens up the possiblity of moving away from costly and insecure windows desktops to a more robust and cheaper to run Ubuntu Linux desktop. Preloaded with firefox web browser and the open office suite of office applications, Ubuntu is an excellent choice for a business desktop.

If you want to increase productivity whilst simultaneously slashing operating costs, get in touch with Edmonds Commerce today to find out how a bespoke online business system can improve your business.
