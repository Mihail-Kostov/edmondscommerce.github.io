Often you'll want to acheive a certain task on Linux and a great way to start is to find commands on Stack Overflow and forums. But running commands without knowing what they do can be dangerous.

[Explain Shell](http://explainshell.com/) parses your command, as well as man pages and breaks your command into explainable chunks. Each utility and flag is documented in-line, helping you understand what's going on and hopefully avoiding any messy mistakes
