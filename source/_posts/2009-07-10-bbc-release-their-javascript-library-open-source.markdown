I read on <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/ouh-shiny-bbcs-glow-is-finally-out" rel="nofollow">Ajaxian</a> today that the BBC have released their own javascript library, Glow,  as open source. This is a nice move on the part of the BBC and great news for anyone looking to develop a site with some nice AJAX features but with a priority on accessibility and broad browser support.

The core reason that the BBC use their own library instead of one of the existing javascript libraries is one of browser support. As stated on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/glow/docs/articles/what_is_glow.shtml" rel="nofollow">Glow site</a>:

<blockquote>However, on reviewing the major libraries we found that none met our standards and guidelines, with browser support in particular being a major issue.</blockquote>
