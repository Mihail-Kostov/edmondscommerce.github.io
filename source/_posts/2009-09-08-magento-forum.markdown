After finding the main Magento forum a bit frustrating to use I have decided to launch our own Magento Forum.

Its totally empty at the moment but we will be keeping an eye on it and will try to answer any Magento questions that come up on the board. 

We are finding that more and more people are launching new sites or migrating existing sites to the Magento platform. We are big believers in the platform and although it isn't perfect (what is) it has a hell of a lot going for it and is definitely the most exciting open source ecommerce platform out there right now, and we suspect for a good few years to come.

So feel free to drop by and start a thread. Don't be shy - take advantage of the quiet to get quick answers to your Magento questions in a convenient forum.
