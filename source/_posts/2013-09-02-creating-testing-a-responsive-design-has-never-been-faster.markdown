Got my hands on these two marvellous responsive design tools from Adobe - <a href="http://www.adobe.com/EdgeReflow" title="Adobe Edge Reflow Homepage" target="_blank">Edge Reflow</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/EdgeInspectâ€Ž" title="Adboe Edge Inspect" target="_blank">Edge Inspect</a>. 

Although Reflow is still in Beta, it has brilliant concept. Never the less <u>it has a potential to redefine the way of how we create and test responsive designs</u> once and for all. A much more effective way. It actually allows you to visualise everything blazing fast by adding different break points and adjusting the layout and design for each of them. Going further - you can test that right away on most of the devices with Edge Inspect. It's that dead easy - just install the app and connect your phone or tablet with your computer to see how the design actually works on the target device.

There are plenty of good resources available that will get you started in no time. The effort of learning it is definitely worth every minute you spend. The most useful resource that I've found so far is the <a href="http://http://www.adobe.com/devnet/edge-reflow/articles/edge-reflow-getting-started.html" title="Edge Reflow Guide for Beginners" target="_blank">original Edge Reflow guide from Adobe itself</a> It is a beginner level guide. Once you understand the core principles everything else is dead easy.
