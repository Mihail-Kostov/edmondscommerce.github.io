I have just finished a project for a client specialising in <a href="http://www.ballicom.co.uk" target="_blank">Computers and Peripherals</a> to take their osCommerce based site (though heavily customised) and apply a fresh new design to the existing site.

For the design work I have hooked up with local web designers <a href="http://www.creode.co.uk/" target="_blank">Creode</a> who are actually based in the same office complex as Edmonds Commerce making colaboration a breeze. I have been impressed with the quality of their work and will definitely be hooking up with them for future projects.

Edmonds Commerce's role in the project was to take the design ideas of Creode and apply them to the existing osCommerce system with the minimum of fuss. We have also added in a few extra nice features such as a popular searches system on sub category pages.

We will shortly be upgrading the site with a streamlined fast checkout procedure as well which will be the icing on the cake.<h4>More...</h4>
