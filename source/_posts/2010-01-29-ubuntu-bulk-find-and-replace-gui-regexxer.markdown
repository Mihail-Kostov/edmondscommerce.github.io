If you need to do a bulk find and replace operation on a load of files within a particular folder structure, for example when refactoring some of your code, then instead of trying to use your IDE you could give this little app a try.

It's called Regexxer:

<a href="http://regexxer.sourceforge.net/">http://regexxer.sourceforge.net/</a>

And is in the Ubuntu repositories (Software Centre) so is only a couple of clicks away from being installed.

(Note previously I have recommended Search Monkey and I still think that's a great tool, but it doesn't seem to do replace, only find).
