When deploying a web application based on a framework like Zend Framework, it can be a bit of a pain to get all the framework files onto the server if you don't have SSH access.

Thankfully it looks like the 1and1 webspace explorer GUI file access system can handle zipping and unzipping files.

Nice :-)
