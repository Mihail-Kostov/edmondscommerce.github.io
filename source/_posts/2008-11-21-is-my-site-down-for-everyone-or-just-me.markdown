For a webmaster that relies on their site as their source of income, such as an ecommerce shop - it can be terrible to see the site become unavailable.. if no one can access your site then you won't make any money!

However, sometimes its not that your site has gone down but that there is something wrong with your internet connection, your ISP or some higher level network problem that will affect some but not all of your sites visitors.

So next time your site goes down, visit <a href="http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/" rel="nofollow">this link</a> and check to see if you site is down or its just you!
