    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I got a notification through that Magento 1.8 had finally been released.</p>

<p>This has been in beta since alpha since April, and contains server fixes that a lot of people have been waiting for.</p>

<p>The most important one for UK vendors is that the rounding issue in tax calculations has been fixed.</p>

<p>There are also improvements to caching and database performance. The full release notes can be seen <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/knowledge-base/entry/ce-18-later-release-notes">here</a></p>

<p>These are issues that have affected merchants since that change in the VAT rate, so we would recommend upgrading for everyone at this time.</p>
