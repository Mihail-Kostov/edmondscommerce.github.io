<p>Baildon Physiotherapy is a sports injury clinic based in Baildon, bradford leeds. They offer expert treatment of a wide variety of musculoskeletal problems.</p>

<p>We have created their new look website from ground up based on client&rsquo;s specification. The website is based on WordPress. We had to customize the look and feel so the website appears as a standard CMS website while utilizing the power of WordPress blog alongside.</p>

<p>Another cool feature we did for this project was to successfully integrate the booking sytem and a contact form. When clients make an appointment as shown on the figure below, the site administrator will automatically be notified as well as the record will appear on the pending list on the booking system in the back-end. The feature was critical for this project.</p>
