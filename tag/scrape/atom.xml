<h2>Bespoke Object-Oriented PHP Automated Scraping System</h2>


<p>The aim of this project is to put together an automated price retrial system, capable of running on its own. The system will collect general information for general products as well as more detailed information for named products.</p>

<h3>Discs Like New</h3>


<p>Discs Like New  offer a professional, effective and affordable <a href=”http://www.discslikenew.com/”>disc repair service </a>to business customers throughout the UK and Europe.</p>

<p><h3>
<img src="/assets/code_snippet.jpg">
The project is interesting as it wants to be run from both a web browser, so it can be set up and product files can be uploaded; and from the command line so it can quietly run in the background. This means that it will have to detect this state and modify what it outputs accordingly.</p>
