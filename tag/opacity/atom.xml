    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have a dual monitor setup you might decide to undock some of your Netbeans windows, for example for running XDebug sessions or PHPUnit testing.</p>

<p>However you will find that by default, Netbeans sets the transparency of these windows to unreadable levels when they are not active.</p>

<p>This really defeats the object and is quite irritating.</p>

<p>I spent a long time under the false impression that this was some errant compiz setting and trying to figure it out that way.</p>

<p>Turns out that this is a Netbeans &ldquo;feature&rdquo; and you can disable it with a single untick of a box.</p>

<p>Tools->Options->Miscellaneous->Appearance</p>

<p>untick the &ldquo;Transparent floating windows&rdquo; box</p>

<p>Enjoy lots of usable desk space in Netbeans!</p>

<p>I recently came across rgba colours which are a very simple and logical way to produce a colour (rgb) with alpha transparency as well. This is ideal if for example you want to create a translucent white box to put some text in.</p>

<p>CSS does have some (dodgy) opacity controls, but they set everything as transparent including any text or pictures contained within the element. By using rgba, we can set a translucent background colour and have opaque elements contained within.</p>

<p>As usual, to get it to work in IE requires some extra effort, however this hack mentioned  <a href="http://css-tricks.com/rgba-browser-support/">here</a> and originally credited <a href="http://www.hedgerwow.com/360/dhtml/rgba/demo.php">here</a> seems to offer a solution.</p>
