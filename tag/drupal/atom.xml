<p>Magento, the ecommerce package that everyone is talking about at the moment and that Edmonds Commerce have been keeping a close eye on for the past couple of years or so has won the <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/open-source/best-open-source-enterprise-software-740&current=7&last=14#slideshowTop">best of open source enterprise software award</a> for the second year running.</p>

<p>Run by InfoWorld, the awards highlight the cream of the current open source crop. Unsurprisingly Drupal came out top for content management, it is definitely the CMS that Edmonds Commerce would recommend and Magento took the Ecommerce Crown. The blog award went to wordpress (what an awesome application).</p>

<p>You can see the full line up <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/open-source/best-open-source-enterprise-software-740">here</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s always tempting when  you are new to a framework or system to just roll your own functionality if the built in functionality is not obvious. I was nearly at that stage with Drupal 6 file uploads. Thankfully before I gave in I found this useful blog post which clearly states how Drupal&rsquo;s built in file upload functionality works. Sweet :&ndash;)</p>

<p>Working on a couple of custom Drupal modules at the moment and I have to say I&rsquo;m really enjoying working with the Drupal forms API. I really feel like I have a wealth of cool features at my disposal without any particular effort or complication. It&rsquo;s a very logical system that does what it does really quite well.</p>

<p>If only the Zend Framework forms component was this easy to use!</p>

<p>Working on a custom Drupal module in Netbeans and wondering how to get Netbeans to treat the file as a PHP file even though the extension is .module?</p>

<p>All you need to do is right click the file and select &ldquo;Open As&rdquo;. Then in the dialog box select the PHP option and that&rsquo;s it. Sorted.</p>
