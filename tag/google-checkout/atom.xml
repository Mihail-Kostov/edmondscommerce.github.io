<p>If you are pulling your hair out trying to figure out why you are seeing a 501 error in your Google Checkout integration console I may well have the answer and solution for you.</p>

<p>This is the error message you will see in the integration console.</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>We encountered an error trying to access your server at https://domain.co.uk/googlecheckout/api/ -- the error we got is Sending failed with HTTP response code: 501. Response body was: &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt; &lt;TITLE&gt;501 Not Implemented&lt;/TITLE&gt; &lt;/HEAD&gt; &lt;BODY&gt; &lt;H1&gt;Not Implemented&lt;/H1&gt; The page you are looking for cannot be displayed because a header value in the request does not match certain configuration settings on the Web server.&lt;P&gt; &lt;HR&gt; &lt;ADDRESS&gt; Web Server at domain.co.uk &lt;/ADDRESS&gt; &lt;/BODY&gt; &lt;/HTML&gt; &lt;!-- - Unfortunately, Microsoft has added a clever new - "feature" to Internet Explorer. If the text of - an error's message is "too small", specifically - less than 512 bytes, Internet Explorer returns - its own error message. You can turn that off, - but it's pretty tricky to find switch called - "smart error messages". That means, of course, - that short error messages are censored by default. - IIS always returns error messages that are long - enough to make Internet Explorer happy. The - workaround is pretty simple: pad the error - message with a big comment like this to push it - over the five hundred and twelve bytes minimum. - Of course, that's exactly what you're reading - right now. --&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The first thing to do is log into your server via SSH and examine the error logs.</p>

<p>find the error logs, open the file up in vi using this command:</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>vi error_log</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Then go to the bottom of the file using the ```shift
 + [g] shortcut. Then to search backwards in the log use the following command:</p>

<p>[code]
?ModSecurity</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>If you find something with this error message then you have mod security installed. If you search around you may well find an error message like this:</p>

<blockquote>
[Thu Mar 26 10:22:11 2009] [error] [client 94.229.166.12] ModSecurity: Access denied with code 501 (phase 2).

</blockquote>


<p>This error message tells us which particular rule is causing it to fail. What we need to do now is either edit this rule or disable it altogether. I will first try to edit it so that the request can get through, but the rule is still active. The rule we need to edit is in this rules file:</p>

<p>modsecurity_crs_30_http_policy.conf</p>

<p>and is on line 71.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m no mod security expert. Having had a quick look through the documentation I am not sure how to edit this rule to allow Google Checkout callbacks through. So for the time being I am going to disable this particular rule altogether by adding a  # in front of lines 70,71 and 72.</p>

<p>If any mod security experts out there read this blog and know a better solution please do post it in the comments.</p>
