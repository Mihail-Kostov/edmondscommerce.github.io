    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is so much information about SEO out there and so many things that used
to be true but are no longer that it really has become a bit of a minefield.</p>

<p>For the average web master who simply wants to rank reasonably well and make sure that they are doign all of the basic things required to do so then this is the document you should read.</p>

<p>It is written by the company that are almost synonymous with the word search engine. In fact their company name has now become a verb meaning &lsquo;to use a search engine&rsquo;. It is of course Google.</p>

<p>You can read the official google SEO guidelines <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.co.uk/en/uk/webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf">here</a></p>

<p>It is not a huge document and should be well within the technical understanding of the average webmaster.</p>

<p>I suggest you read it today!</p>
