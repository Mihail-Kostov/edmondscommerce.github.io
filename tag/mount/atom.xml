<p>If you use Linux on a regular basis, you&rsquo;ll probably know just how useful a symlink is.</p>

<p>This makes things extremely annoying when a program refuses to work with them &ndash; treats them as a file or just refuses to work.</p>

<p>Enter: <strong>mount &mdash;bind</strong></p>

<p>mount &mdash;bind is a special type of mount that will mount one directory as a child of another.  Quite often this is used for simplifying partitioning or if a cpanel server runs out of disk space.</p>

<p>The general usage at the commandline is :&ndash;
<code>mount &mdash;bind olddir newdir</code></p>

<p>and in the fstab :&ndash;
<code>olddir    newdir      none    defaults,bind   0   0</code></p>

<p>For instance, setting up a system where /home, /var and /opt share a partition and everything else is on another can be done like this in your fstab :&ndash;
<code></p>

<h1>root fs</h1>

<p>UUID=ebb8043d-6f1e-4a65-8d73-2c05f7ec213a /               xfs     defaults        0       1</p>

<h1>two tibibyte partition</h1>

<p>UUID=6210e43f-83a3-4001-83c7-40e3b1fb9c8e /twotib         xfs     defaults        0       2</p>

<h1>Following binds</h1>

<p>/twotib/home    /home       none    defaults,bind   0   0
/twotib/opt /opt        none    defaults,bind   0   0
/twotib/var /var        none    defaults,bind   0   0
</code></p>

<p>If you have a secondary hard drive that you have to manually mount in Ubuntu/Linux everytime you boot up and you are not too comfortable with the syntax for fstab, this is a possible easy shortcut for you.</p>

<p>You can view the currently mounted partitions by looking at mtap</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>cat /etc/mtab</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>If you do this after you have mounted the drive, you can see the full mount command that has been used, eg</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>/dev/sdc1 /media/BigDrive ext4 rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=udisks 0 0</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>You can copy that line and paste it into your fstab and from then on when you boot up the drive will be mounted automatically.</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>sudo gedit /etc/fstab</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>I have no idea what all that stuff means and to be honest I don&rsquo;t care I just want to use my hard drive.</p>

<p>ALWAYS back up your fstab before making changes!</p>

<p>Hope that helps ;)</p>

<p>If like me you have a Linux drive, but also run NTFS drives for windows/buntu compatability reasons (in my case, simply archive drives that I haven&rsquo;t got around to moving from NTFS to EXT).</p>

<p>After nuking my machine thanks to trying a variety of advice found on the net. (I don&rsquo;t recommend you use pySDM &ndash; it Killed my machine thanks a a user interface that allows you to select the drive you want to edit on the left pane, but actually you are still editing your main drive!)</p>

<p>In fact the final solution was really easy.</p>

<p>To automate mounting NTFS partitions in ubuntu, simply do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make sure no drives are currently mounted that you want to automate</p></li>
<li><p>Install NTFS-config
<code>
sudo apt-get install ntfs-config
</code></p></li>
<li><p>Run NTFS-config
<code>
sudo ntfs-config
</code></p></li>
</ol>


<p>Select the drive you want to auto mount, tick all boxes</p>
