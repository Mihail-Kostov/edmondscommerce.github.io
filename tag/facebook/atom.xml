<p>We told you about <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/php/php-into-compiled-c-hip-hop-by-facebook/">HipHop</a> a while back and we were pretty excited about it.</p>

<p>Now Facebook have decided to develop a virtual machine to allow dynamic translation and faster results than their previous interpreter based approach. This is paving the way for further performance improvements and ease of development.</p>

<p>You can read the full story <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150415177928920">here</a>.</p>

<p>We suspect it is still some way before this kind of thing will be more widely adopted but its certainly a good thing for PHP.</p>

<h2>Stage Gear – General Site Improvements</h2>


<p>Stage Gear needed a number of aspects of their OSCommerce site improving, including the look and feel, the addition of SEO URLs to improve site ranking, improving search on the site and adding basic Facebook integration.</p>

<h3>Stage Gear</h3>


<p>Stage Gear is a company that specialise in retailing <a href="http://www.sound-light-company.co.uk/">sound and lighting equipment</a> for use by clubs, pubs, bands and DJs.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/stagegear-300x224.png"></p>

<p>This project was terrific as it demonstrates that OSCommerce is still fully capable of running a modern web site.</p>

<p>Very interesting this one:</p>

<p><a href="http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?story=358&blog;=1"><a href="http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?story=358&amp;blog;=1">http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?story=358&amp;blog;=1</a></a></p>

<blockquote>With HipHop we've reduced the CPU usage on our Web servers on average by about fifty percent</blockquote>


<p>sounds good to me :)</p>

<blockquote>HipHop for PHP isn't technically a compiler itself. Rather it is a source code transformer. HipHop programmatically transforms your PHP source code into highly optimized C++ and then uses g++ to compile it.</blockquote>
