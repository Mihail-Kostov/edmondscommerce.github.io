    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Often a client won&rsquo;t have access to SSH, or won&rsquo;t be able to provide you with some of the more specifics such as FTP, PHPMyAdmin etc. All they know to give you is access to their cPanel. Through this there&rsquo;s various tools at your disposal.</p>

<h2>Try SSH</h2>

<p>Your cPanel login is actually a Linux user login, which cPanel&rsquo;s FTP hooks into. The first step is to navigate in your cPanel to FTP Accounts and click Configure FTP client on a user. These are SFTP details and can very often provide you with SSH shell access, unless the host has disabled this.</p>

<p>Simply try <code>ssh user@host -p 1234</code>, where the user, host and password are your cPanel login, and the port displayed on the FTP Accounts page.</p>

<p>From here you&rsquo;re free to use <code>tar</code>, <code>gzip</code>, <code>mysqldump</code> etc to acquire the files and database.</p>

<h2>If SSH isn&rsquo;t enabled</h2>

<p>Sometimes the host disables SSH access, only allowing its use for SFTP. There are still many ways to acquire the site&rsquo;s files and database:</p>

<h3>Getting hold of the files</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Plain old FTP</strong> &ndash; You can just use an FTP client such as Filezilla to access and download the site&rsquo;s files using FTP or SFTP. This is the simplest way, but can take a long time because of the amount of files involved</li>
<li><strong>File Manager Web UI</strong> &ndash; compressing the site&rsquo;s files obviously shrinks the download size, but also vastly reduces the amount of connections you need to make, leading to a faster download speed.

<ol>
<li> Navigate to the File Manager section (remember to tick &ldquo;Show hidden files&rdquo; to pick up .htaccess files)</li>
<li>Browse to the web root folder, select all the files and folders you want using Ctrl+Click. Remember to exclude unnecessary large files such as sql dumps, media folders and the var folder</li>
<li>Click Compress from the toolbar</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Getting hold of the database</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>PHPMyAdmin</strong> &ndash; PHPMyAdmin offers an array of options for dumping your database. You should start by checking the database&rsquo;s size and considering excluding the dump of tables such as <code>log_url</code>, <code>log_url_info</code>, <code>log_visitor</code>, <code>log_visitor_info</code>, <code>report_viewed_product_index</code>

<ol>
<li> Navigate to the PHPMyAdmin area of cPanel and locate the database in use (check your <code>app/etc/local.xml</code> if you&rsquo;re not sure which</li>
<li>Click the Export tab</li>
<li>Select Custom: here&rsquo;s where you can selectively export information</li>
<li>Tick &lsquo;Disable foreign key checks&rsquo; and set &lsquo;Dump table&rsquo; to &lsquo;structure&rsquo;. This will have PHPMyAdmin set up only the tables' columns but no data (we&rsquo;ll get to that)</li>
<li>Click Go</li>
<li>Once this is complete, navigate back to the Export page and click Custom again.</li>
<li>Deselect (ctrl+click) any tables which are unnecessary</li>
<li>Tick &lsquo;Disable foreign key checks&rsquo; and set &lsquo;Dump table&rsquo; this time to &lsquo;data&rsquo;</li>
<li>This will provide you with two files representing the database. Import first the Structure one, and then the Data one (or concatenate the two together)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/using-magento-database-migrations-to-track-configuration-changes.html"/>

    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/using-magento-database-migrations-to-track-configuration-changes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Often when working on a Magento site, there is a requirement to build custom functionality or implement new themes etc but to finish the job, the final step will be to perform some admin configuration.</p>

<p>This manual step can introduce the possiblity of human error if a step is missed or not performed exactly correctly.</p>

<p>Also if the configuration is to be applied multiple times across staging, pre production and final production then these risks increase.</p>

<p>The only sure way to make sure that the correct configuration is applied and also to provide a proper audit trail for configuration changes is to use Magento&rsquo;s database migrations &ndash; install and upgrade scripts &ndash; to update the database programmatically with the required configuration changes.</p>

<p>To assist with this, there is a nice simple module you can find on Git Hub:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/danslo/MigrationHelper"><a href="https://github.com/danslo/MigrationHelper">https://github.com/danslo/MigrationHelper</a></a></p>

<p>This module will automatically create the migration files for you which can be a real time saver.</p>

<p>I would always suggest you create your own custom namespaced configuration migration module that is purely to track these configuration changes.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have a staging copy of your site anywhere then you might not bother copying over your entire catalogue of product images etc.</p>

<p>You might decide to drop in absolute URLs for those images so that they are pulled from live. However you really don&rsquo;t want absolute URLs in your code and you certainly don&rsquo;t want that to go live because it just adds unnecessary bloat.</p>

<p>A nice trick you can do here is make a change to your staging site as follows. Of course ensure this change doesn&rsquo;t go live, but it should be just one file so that&rsquo;s easy to handle.</p>

<p>(Note this assumes you already have jQuery available on your page)</p>

<p>```javascript</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
$().ready(function(){
    $('img').each(function(){
        var src = $(this).attr('src')+'';        
        if(-1 == src.indexOf('http')){
            var new_src = 'http://www.LIVEDOMAIN.co.uk/'+src;
            $(this).attr('src', new_src);
        }
    });
});    
</script>


<p>```</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to change LIVEDOMAIN to be your real live domain</p>
