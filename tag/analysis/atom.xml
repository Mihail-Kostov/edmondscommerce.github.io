    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When embarking on a project to launch or relaunch an e-commerce web site it can seem like a daunting and overwhelming prospect. The danger is that without proper planning and project management, the final outcome can be much less effective and efficient than if proper planning and preliminary research is used to define clear goals and then ensure these are met.</p>

<p>In my role as user experience designer, web designer and design project management I always advise clients to follow a clear and defined process to get the best results. The following describes this process in detail. If you have any questions regarding this article or would like to discuss your redesign or launch project with us please <a href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/contact-us">do get in touch</a>.</p>

<h3>Project Plan Overview</h3>




<blockquote><em>Abraham Lincoln - If I had six hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend the first four hours sharpening the axe.</em></blockquote>


<p>Planning is extremely important.</p>

<p>From what I&rsquo;ve learned I tend to break down every project in following phases.</p>

<ul>
 <li>1. Research and Planning</li>
 <li>2. Wire-framing</li>
 <li>3. Visual Design</li>
 <li>4. Front-end development</li>
 <li>5. Back-end development</li>
 <li>6. Content entry</li>
 <li>7. Testing</li>
 <li>8. Launch</li>
<li>9. Ongoing Support and Maintainence</li>
</ul>




<h2>Project Phases</h2>


<p>Here is some more details on the specific steps of a project.</p>

<h3>Research and Planning</h3>


<p>This phase is perhaps the most important. Discoveries made here will have a dramatic impact on decisions made later on in the project and the key is to ensure we gather as much high quality information as possible to facilitate the optimum plan for the project.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Requirements gathering – the most important phase. Try to get as much information as possible. It may take a lot of time at the beginning to set clear goals and strategies, but it will speed up the project management later on. That’s why it’s broken down to:

    <ul><li>Business requirements – what are the goals on the project monetization</li></ul>

    <ul><li>Design requirements – are there some special design considerations</li></ul>

    <ul><li>Technology Requirements – are there some limitations to platform or language, etc.</li></ul>

    <ul><li>User Requirements – who is this project created for, what’s the main audience, describe it as detailed as possible and create personas.</li></li></ul></ul>


<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Industry best practices / reports – see what’s already out there, what kind of research is available to speed up the learning curve. This step gathers very important information on which aspects to focus in competitor analysis.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Competitor analysis – see what strategies main competitors are using, identify their strengths and weaknesses, make short proposal of unique or best approach based on obtained intelligence. It really helps to create a checklist – to which against the competitors are analysed.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Overall Project Planning – after all of the basic information is gathered about the upcoming project, the competitors and the industry closely researched - create a basic proposal of what to include in the project and why (communicate the benefits). This is a good place for short recommendations on features, strategy, frameworks, platform, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></ul></p>

<h3>Wireframing</h3>


<p>Once the plan is in place we know everything that we want on the site. The next phase is to put together a wireframe (also referred to as a mockup) of the site that arranges the pages and structure of the site with all features. Wireframes are very simple layouts with no advanced colour or visuals and allow us to focus on layout and structure exclusively.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Site map – create a map of all included pages and write short user stories about them. It will play an important role to understand the total volume of the project and organize it. Help yourself as a web project manager - to keep with the plan and make sure that nothing is missed. It is a good visual material to present to your client as well.</li>

    <li>Low-to-High Fidelity Wireframes – Allows to define information hierarchy of each page and visualises the end-user behaviour. Start by determining layout by boxes only, simply play around various sceneries and get client feedback early. After conceptual layout is signed off, proceed to next phase by adding main typography elements and some real content to ensure that both - client and you are on the same track of understanding. Don't worry that already signed off layout needs changes, it's normal to evolve, after all - quality is what matters and the one who changes – survives. Feel free to use colour (I recommend Gray Scale) to set element priority within the wireframe. (For better wire framing and presenting I personally recommend <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/fireworks/2013/05/the-future-of-adobe-fireworks.html" title="The future of Adobe Fireworks" target="_blank">as Adobe announced to stop further development of Fireworks</a>)</li>

    <li>Functional specification – It’s extremely important to clarify all use sceneries and functions. Like what happens when item is added to cart and so on. Describe and visually enhance specification by adding meaningful images and annotations directly in wire-frames. Make sure to maintain close communication with Client and sign off the stage once it’s done.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Design</h3>


<p>Once the wireframes are completed and signed off with the client, the next phase is to start implementing those layouts as fully fledged visual designs. At this phase things like colour, shape and style become the focus. The design is in no way functional, the result is a flat image that will represent exactly how the web site will look.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Overall design – focus on first page, header and footer. Try to think over all elements and design rules, create the overall feel. This usually takes much longer time than any other section of site.</li>

    <li>Page design – just follow the wire-frames and overall design rules.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Completion</h3>


<p>When the designs are finalised the project passes across to the more technical side of the team for the process of making a live dynamic web site based upon the wireframes and designs.</p>

<p>The front end development phase is the conversion of the design into HTML, CSS and JavaScript that can be rendered in a web browser.</p>

<p>Back end development involves making your CMS system or platform such as Magento or WordPress generate the correct HTML and CSS, generally as part of a custom theme. This phase also includes building any custom functionality that is required or implied by the design.</p>

<p>Once the theme is live, the next phase is to populate the site with content. This could include products and categories, pages and articles or any other content that gives the site its true purpose and structure.</p>

<p>The final step before launch is to thoroughly test the site in a secure staging environment. Staging environments should be password protected with no chance of search engine spiders discovering and indexing the site before launch.</p>

<p>Once all parties are happy that the site is working perfectly, the final step is to launch the site. This generally involves deploying code and database to a live web server. Often this phase also includes some server setup and optimisation to ensure the site is working perfectly.</p>

<p>Once the site is launched, a phase of ongoing support and maintenance ensues which may last for weeks, months or indefinitely depending on the scale of the site and your ambitions for future growth and improvements.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>


<p>These are few of the basic guidelines for effective web project management. I don&rsquo;t insist that this is the one and the only right approach, it&rsquo;s just the approach that helps me to get the project done to the highest standards.</p>

<p>This approach is constantly evolving as new techniques and tools are discovered. I haven&rsquo;t gone into the details of development, testing and launch phases as this article is mostly focused on design and planning phases which is my primary role.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here is a little bash script we knocked together to track down some malicious activity on a clients server.</p>

<p>Using a bit of awk etc to parse the log files we could quickly track down an IP address that was overloading the server and then take steps to block that person.</p>

<p>Here is the script:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>!/bin/bash</h1>

<h6>SETUP</h6>

<p>LOG_FOLDER=/var/www/vhosts/domain.co.uk/statistics/logs
ACCESS_LOG=$LOG_FOLDER/access_log</p>

<p>HOW_MANY_ROWS=20000</p>

<h6>### FUNCTIONS</h6>

<p>function title() {</p>

<pre><code>echo "
</code></pre>

<hr />

<h2>$@</h2>

<p>&ldquo;
}</p>

<p>function urls_by_ip() {</p>

<pre><code>local IP=$1
tail -5000 $ACCESS_LOG | awk -v ip=$IP ' $1 ~ ip {freq[$7]++} END {for (x in freq) {print freq[x], x}}' | sort -rn | head -20
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>function ip_addresses_by_user_agent(){</p>

<pre><code>local USERAGENT_STRING="$1"
local TOP_20_IPS="`tail  -$HOW_MANY_ROWS $ACCESS_LOG | grep "${USERAGENT_STRING}"  | awk '{freq[$1]++} END {for (x in freq) {print freq[x], x}}' | sort -rn | head -20`"
echo "$TOP_20_IPS"
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<h6># RUN REPORTS</h6>

<p>title &ldquo;top 20 URLs&rdquo;
TOP_20_URLS=&ldquo;<code>tail -$HOW_MANY_ROWS $ACCESS_LOG | awk '{freq[$7]++} END {for (x in freq) {print freq[x], x}}' | sort -rn | head -20</code>&rdquo;
echo &ldquo;$TOP_20_URLS&rdquo;</p>

<p>title &ldquo;top 20 URLS excluding POST data&rdquo;
TOP_20_URLS_WITHOUT_POST=&ldquo;<code>tail  -$HOW_MANY_ROWS $ACCESS_LOG | awk -F"[ ?]" '{freq[$7]++} END {for (x in freq) {print freq[x], x}}' | sort -rn | head -20</code>&rdquo;
echo &ldquo;$TOP_20_URLS_WITHOUT_POST&rdquo;</p>

<p>title &ldquo;top 20 IPs&rdquo;
TOP_20_IPS=&ldquo;<code>tail  -$HOW_MANY_ROWS $ACCESS_LOG | awk '{freq[$1]++} END {for (x in freq) {print freq[x], x}}' | sort -rn | head -20</code>&rdquo;
echo &ldquo;$TOP_20_IPS&rdquo;</p>

<p>title &ldquo;top 20 user agents&rdquo;
TOP_20_USER_AGENTS=&ldquo;<code>tail  -$HOW_MANY_ROWS $ACCESS_LOG | cut -d\  -f12- | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20</code>&rdquo;
echo &ldquo;$TOP_20_USER_AGENTS&rdquo;</p>

<p>title &ldquo;IP Addresses for Top 3 User Agents&rdquo;</p>

<p>for ((I=1; I&lt;=3; I++))
do</p>

<pre><code>UA="`echo "$TOP_20_USER_AGENTS" | head -n $I | tail -n 1 | awk '{$1=""; print $0}'`"
echo "$UA"
echo "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
ip_addresses_by_user_agent "$UA"
echo "

</code></pre>

<p>done</p>

<p>We told you about <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/php/php-into-compiled-c-hip-hop-by-facebook/">HipHop</a> a while back and we were pretty excited about it.</p>

<p>Now Facebook have decided to develop a virtual machine to allow dynamic translation and faster results than their previous interpreter based approach. This is paving the way for further performance improvements and ease of development.</p>

<p>You can read the full story <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150415177928920">here</a>.</p>

<p>We suspect it is still some way before this kind of thing will be more widely adopted but its certainly a good thing for PHP.</p>
