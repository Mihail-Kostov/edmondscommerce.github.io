<p>The array_walk function is one of those unassuming little PHP functions that a lot of people may well ignore, but it is often very useful and can save writing out lines of code, compressing a pretty common coding structure into a single function call. Of course that also means that it is fast!</p>

<p>However, the standard documentation doesn&rsquo;t make it clear if you can use array_walk on an array and use a class method as the callback rather than a global function. You can and here is how to do it:</p>

<p>```php</p>

<p>$object = new MyClass;
$array = array(/<em> some array </em>/);
array_walk($array, array($object, &lsquo;methodName&rsquo;));</p>

<p>```</p>
