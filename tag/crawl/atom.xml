    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of our Magento SEO service, the first thing we do is to make sure there are no issues with the crawlability and general health of the clients web site.</p>

<p>Whilst working on the Google Webmaster Tools crawl errors for a client I noticed one specific and intruiging problem for which I couldn&rsquo;t immediately see the reason, everything looked to be set up perfectly.</p>

<p>Certain URLs were getting 404 responses. The URL was being parsed by mod_rewrite but everything looked fine so why was apache giving a 404?</p>

<p>The problem turns out to be that the URLs contain escaped slashes (eg search/KTA-mb667k2%2F2g),</p>

<p>The problem is that Apache actually handles the escaped slash and helpfully converts it to a real slash. That then means that it is trying to look in a sub folder that does not exist and hence the 404.</p>

<p>Chances are you don&rsquo;t want escaped slashes to really be thought of as real directory separating slashes, especially if you are using mod_rewrite.</p>

<p>The answer is a simple one liner to be added to your vhost.conf or httpd.conf.</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>AllowEncodedSlashes On</p>

<p>```</p>
