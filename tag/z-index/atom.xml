<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever had that annoying problem where someone has asked you to put a flash banner on a site and it covers up your nice dropdown or pop-out menus, you&rsquo;ll be glad to know that the current versions of flash don&rsquo;t do that if you set the right parameter!  Yes that even includes flash on Linux browsers!</p>

<p>The parameter is called &ldquo;wmode&rdquo; and needs to be set to &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; for the z-index problem to go away.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that search engines don&rsquo;t read the text in flash files so you don&rsquo;t want to use flash where you don&rsquo;t have to, but when a banner is required and is provided by a third party it&rsquo;s not always possible to avoid it.</p>
