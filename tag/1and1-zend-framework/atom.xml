<p>Been tearing my hair out this morning trying to figure out why a Zend Framework based app was giving me 404 messages on any actions that specified the index controller. To explain, any URL that ended with /index or index/{action_name} would give me the ugly 1and1 404 message.</p>

<p>locally of course it worked fine. I messed around with my error controller but it seemed that the ZF app wasn&rsquo;t even being consulted, this was a lower level 404 error.</p>

<p>After some digging around, the solution is to disable something called MultiViews. The MultiViews option allows a file to be called even if the extension is not loaded, so index would look for any files called index, regardless of their extension.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure why you would want this behaviour, maybe that&rsquo;s why I have never encountered it before. Anyway, to disable it and get your app working the way you want, simply add the following line to your htaccess file:</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Options -MultiViews</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>For information, this is my full htaccess file that works on 1and1 hosting:</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Options -MultiViews
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -s [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -l [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
RewriteRule ^.<em>$ &ndash; [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^.</em>$ /path/from/docroot/public/ [NC,L]</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>This particular app is running from a subfolder. If your public folder is the document root then that line would simply be /</p>
