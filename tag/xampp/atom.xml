    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When using PHPUnit with xampp the first the to do is install PHPUnit through pear. You usually need to update pear first, after that you should be able to follow the instructions <a href="http://pear.phpunit.de/">here</a></p>

<p>Getting PHPUnit working with Magento is fairly straight forward. It&rsquo;s just a case of including Mage.php and then calling Mage::app(); in the setup method of your test class:</p>

<p>```php
&lt;?php</p>

<p>require_once &lsquo;../app/Mage.php&rsquo;;</p>

<p>class TemplateTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase {</p>

<pre><code>public function setUp() {
    Mage::app();
}

public function testExample() {
    $helper = Mage::helper('core');
    $this-&gt;assertTrue($helper instanceof Mage_Core_Helper_Data, "Magento isn't running!");
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>If you use NetBeans as your IDE you&rsquo;ll be glad to know that it has support for running your tests directly without having to use a terminal. This does require a bit of configuration. You need to tell NetBeans where the PHPUnit script is under Tools > Options > PHP > Unit Testing. If you are using it with XAMPP it will be located at /opt/lampp/bin/phpunit. To begin running the tests you then go Run > Test Project and NetBeans will ask you where your tests are. After that you will get a &ldquo;Test File&rdquo; source folder in the Projects pane. You can now right click each test file and choose &ldquo;Run file&rdquo; and netbeans will run it. If you have xdebug setup the debug option also works nicely.</p>

<p>For some reason the upgrade seems to have installed Apache which then conflicts with my XAMPP apache.</p>

<p>This prevents me from starting the XAMPP apache. To fix this simply search for apache in Synaptic package manager and uninstall it. XAMPP apache should then start fine.</p>

<p><strong>1]</strong> Download the latest version of ( XAMPP For Linux ) <a href='http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html'>here</a>
<strong>2]</strong> Install it. To install lampp, extract and put in /opt directory. Remember to extract it as ROOT.
<strong>3]</strong> Download Development package from same site.
<strong>4]</strong> Extract it, copy and paste &ldquo;include&rdquo; folder from Development package to /opt/lampp directory. ( This package would use for compiling XDebug source )
<strong>5]</strong> Run command;Â  sudo /opt/lampp/bin/pecl update-channels. this would update the pecl channels database at your local pc.
<strong>6]</strong> Run command sudo /opt/lampp/bin/pecl install Xdebug. And wait for finishing the process.
<strong>7]</strong> Now xdebug.so file has been created in /opt/lampp/lib/php/extensions/ directory.
<strong>8]</strong> Now Open the file php.ini and add the line zend_extension=&ldquo;/opt/lampp/lib/php/extensions/path_to_xdebug.so&rdquo;. at the end of file.
<strong>9]</strong> Restart Lampp &amp; Check enabled or not using phpinfo();</p>

<h1>TESTING INSTALLATION::</h1>

<p><strong>1]</strong> Ensure LAMP is started/running (i.e apache, mysql)
<strong>2]</strong> Open your favorite browser i.e FireFox
<strong>3]</strong> Type <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a> (if all is well this should take you to the Xampp homepage and ask you to select your prefered language!. This ensures your htdocs web folder is reachable and web server is working fine.)
<strong>4]</strong> Type <a href="http://localhost/phpmyadmin">http://localhost/phpmyadmin</a> (if all is well this should take you to the mysql admin homepage!. This ensures your mysql database is configured correctly and ready is ready to go!)</p>

<h1>NOTE:</h1>

<p>If the installation is not done as root, you may experience few security issues while testing your installation:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a> &ndash; may throw errors relating to permissions while trying to open files notably &lsquo;lang.tmp.php&rsquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://localhost/phpmyadmin">http://localhost/phpmyadmin</a> &ndash; may throw errors relating to not been able to read &lsquo;config.php&rsquo; and also connection to mysql database may fail.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Solution:</h1>

<p>Re-Install lampp as root to eliminate such problems.</p>

<p>I have put together an XAMPP based portable Magento demo site. You can easily download it to your windows PC, drop the xampp folder into the root of your C: drive, launch the XAMPP control panel to start Apache and MySQL and then you are away.</p>

<p>You can get the files on GitHub here:
<a href="http://github.com/edmondscommerce/XAMPP-Magento-Demo-Site"><a href="http://github.com/edmondscommerce/XAMPP-Magento-Demo-Site">http://github.com/edmondscommerce/XAMPP-Magento-Demo-Site</a></a></p>

<p>Please read the README which is displayed at the bottom of the GitHub page for up to date instructions.</p>

<p>If you are using XAMPP on Ubuntu (or probably other) Linux and are also trying to use the MySQL Administrator and MySQL Query Browser GUI tools available in the repo&rsquo;s, you have probably hit an error message like this:</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Could not connect to host &lsquo;localhost&rsquo;.
MySQL Error Nr. 2002
Can&rsquo;t connect to local MySQL server through socket &lsquo;/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock&rsquo; (2)</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>A nice quick fix for this one. In the terminal run the following two commands and then you should be able to connect fine using localhost as the host and the configured MySQL username and password, probably root and {password}.</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>sudo mkdir /var/run/mysqld/</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>sudo ln -s /opt/lampp/var/mysql/mysql.sock /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock</p>

<p>```</p>
