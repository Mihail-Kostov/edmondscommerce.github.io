    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>The problem with quoted replies</h2>

<p>One of Gmail&rsquo;s stronger features is its threaded email conversations, allowing you to see emails as a chain of the back-and-forth, instead of the classic Inbox and Sent folder situation.</p>

<p>Mail clients often include the email chain as part of the email itself, and for the most part these are marked up in such a way that Gmail can hide them with the small ellipses button.</p>

<p>Sometimes though this doesn&rsquo;t work, and you end up having to scroll past page after page of quoted replies, which can be a right pain.</p>

<p>In probably 75% of the cases these have some HTML wrapped around them, which we can use to hide them when needed.</p>

<h2>Using Stylish to hide them in your browser</h2>

<p>Because Gmail is a web-based client, you can use normal browser extensions to manipulate it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylish">Stylish</a> is a browser extension that allows you to set up CSS rules that are applied on the pages you&rsquo;re using.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a snippet of CSS that will hide the needless quoted replies, with the ability to hover over them if you really need to see them</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>// Make quoted replies a small block
.im, .gmail_extra {
  height:30px;
  width:100px;
  background:#EFEFEF;
  overflow:hidden;
  display:block;
}</p>

<p>// Allow these to be expanded when hovered
.im:hover,
.gmail_extra:hover
{
  height:auto;
  max-height:250px;
  width:auto;
  overflow:auto;
  background:#EFEFEF;
}</p>

<p>// Show a little notice that they can be expanded
.im:before, .gmail_extra:before {
  content:&ldquo;Snipped Quote, hover to expand&rdquo;;
  color:#666666;
}</p>

<p>// Don&rsquo;t hide nested quote blocks
.im .im,
.gmail_extra .gmail_extra,
.im .gmail_extra,
.gmail_extra .im</p>

<pre><code>  {
</code></pre>

<p>  height:auto;
  max-height:none;
  width:auto;
  overflow:auto;
  background:#EFEFEF;
}</p>

<p>.gmail_extra .im:before {
  content:&ldquo;&rdquo;;
}</p>

<p>```</p>

<h2>The result</h2>

<p>What was previously a big mess of nested quotes and signatures</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2015-03-02-GmailQuote1.png"></p>

<p>Becomes a small &ldquo;Hover to expand&rdquo; box</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2015-03-02-GmailQuote2.png"></p>

<p>Viewing it in the scrollable box</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2015-03-02-GmailQuote3.png"></p>

<p>These styles work at the date of publication, but obviously Google might change the classes used for these.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was writing an email to a customer, and had created a Google Drive spreadsheet for us to collaborate on, I put a link to the document into the email, intending to share the document with the customer immediately after.</p>

<p>To my surprise when I hit Send a prompt came up asking me if I want to share the linked document with the email recipients. You can choose to have it publicly viewable/editable using the link, or even to add the email&rsquo;s recipients to the document&rsquo;s share list (which of course requires them to be using a Google account).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you use Gmail (also bundled with Google Apps) for your business then you probably write a lot of emails directly into the gmail interface. If you are like me you probably make teh the mistakes all teh time. (See what I did there!)</p>

<p>As the MD of Edmonds Commerce I probably write more emails than most people with everything from <a href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/platforms/magento">Magento</a> quotes, client communications, enquiries and maybe even the occasional personal email. At a guess I would say I write a good few thousand words per day. I should calculate that one day.</p>

<p>Well help is at hand with this wonderful chrome extension that will auto correct common typos as you type them in gmail. For me this is a real productivity booster as I type fast but badly and this really tidies up a lot of my common mistakes meaning less <em>backspace</em> and more <em>getting stuff done</em>.</p>

<p>You can grab the extension <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ezautocorrect-for-gmail/fholdolknchpdbajhpdenookmikblmda/related" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you find it useful. On another note, if you aren&rsquo;t currently using Google Apps (its free you know) and would like to look at transitioning your business to the system then get in touch with us and we would be happy to help you with it. I can not recommend the service enough to be honest, even if you go for the paid version the cost is negligible really. Smaller companies should be find with the free version though which you really can&rsquo;t argue with.</p>

<p>The new gmail look certainly makes it look the same as many of Google&rsquo;s other services, but it&rsquo;s quite space in efficient by default. Fortunately Google thought of that and made it&rsquo;s space efficiency configurable! There is a button in the top right of gmail that allows you to change it.

<p>If you are struggling trying to get PHPMailer working with Google Apps then perhaps this is the solution for you.</p>

<p>I went to the PHPMailer site and found my way to a SourceForge download. After a lot of debugging and wrestling with this I just could not get it to work. In the end I looked at other projects that I knew were using PHPMailer for their mail and that were working with Google Apps or Gmail and found that their version was drastically more up to date than the one I downloaded from SourceForge.</p>

<p>In a nutshell &ndash; the version I had was never going to work.</p>

<p>A quick update later and I have PHPMailer working with Google Apps.</p>

<p>For reference the version <a href="https://github.com/KyleAMathews/phpmailer/blob/master/class.phpmailer.php">here</a> seems to be the up to date.</p>

<p>Here is some example code that IS working with Google Apps</p>

<p>```php</p>

<p><pre></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$to = 'info@edmondscommerce.co.uk';
$message = 'testing swift mailer';

require("class.phpmailer.php");

$mail = new PHPMailer();

$mail-&gt;IsSMTP();
$mail-&gt;SMTPAuth = true;
$mail-&gt;SMTPSecure = 'tls';
$mail-&gt;Host = 'smtp.gmail.com';
$mail-&gt;Port = 587;

$mail-&gt;Username = 'your@email.com';
$mail-&gt;Password = 'yourpasswordwhatever';

$mail-&gt;From = $to;
$mail-&gt;FromName = 'test';
$mail-&gt;Subject = 'test';
$mail-&gt;WordWrap = 50; // set word wrap

$mail-&gt;Body = eregi_replace("[\]", '', $message);

$mail-&gt;IsHTML(true); // send as HTML
</code></pre>

<p>//To</p>

<pre><code>$mail-&gt;AddAddress($to);
$mail-&gt;SMTPDebug = true;

$mail-&gt;CharSet = 'us-ascii';
$mail-&gt;Encoding = $mail-&gt;Charset != 'us-ascii' ? '8bit' : '7bit';

if (!$mail-&gt;Send()) {
    echo "Message could not be sent. &lt;p&gt;";
    echo "Mailer Error: " . $mail-&gt;ErrorInfo;
    exit;
}
echo "Message has been sent";
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>
