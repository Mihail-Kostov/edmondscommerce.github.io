    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you ever used Webmaster Tools in Firefox but have now switched to using Chrom(e|ium) instead then you probably miss the form filler &ndash; especially if you ever need to test checkouts or other form intensive web site user stories.</p>

<p>A nice little extension that I just discovered takes care of this, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cbpplldpcdcfejdaldmnfhlodoadjhii" target="_blank">Chrome Form Fuzzer</a>.</p>

<p>You can configure it for simple form filling or with a little creative configuration it could easily be used for security testing and more in depth testing to ensure that input is being sanitised and filtered properly.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Widely regarded as best practice, the use of automated tests to ensure the correct functioning of your web application is a really powerful and useful practice.</p>

<p>For Magento it has historically been something that you would need to create yourself.</p>

<p>Now Magento have released a comprehensive package of 1000 tests that you can download as a package.</p>

<p>Based on Selenium the package will allow you to to test your store and will also assist with the creation of your own custom tests.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/blog/comments/automate-your-testing-with-the-magento-test-automation-framework/"><a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/blog/comments/automate-your-testing-with-the-magento-test-automation-framework/">http://www.magentocommerce.com/blog/comments/automate-your-testing-with-the-magento-test-automation-framework/</a></a></p>

<p>Another great development for Magento.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What can be true and false at the same time?
```php</p>

<p>$a = &ldquo;a&rdquo;;
$b = 0;</p>

<p>if($a == true &amp;&amp; $b == false &amp;&amp; $a == $b) {</p>

<pre><code>echo "Passed";
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>This is because PHP tries to convert &ldquo;a&rdquo; to a numeric, as there is no numeric value it gets changed to zero. So 0 == 0 is true. At the same time the string &ldquo;a&rdquo; converted to boolean evaluates to true. 0 evaluates to false. While there isn&rsquo;t an actual value that is both true and false that the same type, depending on the context a value may evaluate to true or false depending on what it is been compared to. To avoid problems like this, you should use triple equals (===) unless you know other wise.</p>

<p>Answer to this quite clear and simple question is:</p>

<p>unetbootin</p>

<p>Not the easiest to find but definitely one of the easiest solutions.</p>

<p>If you search for USB bootable drive generators mostly you will find windows apps.</p>

<p>Not too useful if you are already on Linux and simply want to try the latest version or perhaps an alternative distro on something that is going to give more useful performance than the traditional live CD.</p>

<p><a href="http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/">uNetbootin</a> is a nice solid cross platform USB bootable Linux generator that will even handle the download of ISOs for you if required.</p>

<p>So, you&rsquo;ve just moved a magento setup from one host to another, and you want to check if the email setup is correct, how do you do it?</p>

<p>The simple easy way to do this is to have a test front-end user (which you probably already have) and send a password change email to the user.</p>

<p>A simple trick but a good timesaver.</p>
