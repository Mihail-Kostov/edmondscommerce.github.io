    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the nice features of Gnome Shell is that, with the help of the <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes/">User Theme</a> extension, you can really customise
your desktop experience to be something personalised.</p>

<p>For me, the first thing is to set my desktop background to be a nice picture &ndash; something with wide open spaces, mountains and lots of sky.</p>

<p>The next thing though is to set up a user theme. I like transparency and themes that allow my well chosen background image to shine through.</p>

<p>For this reason I chose the <a href="https://github.com/satya164/elegance-colors">Elegance Colors</a> theme as it has a &ldquo;clear&rdquo; preset which also includes functionality to set the colour scheme based
on the background image which is pretty slick I think.</p>

<p>For installation instructions, please see the <a href="https://github.com/satya164/elegance-colors/blob/master/README.md">README on Github</a></p>

<h2>Quick Fedora instructions are here:</h2>

<h3>Create Repo</h3>

<p>``` bash
sudo sh -c &ldquo; echo &lsquo;[home_satya164_elegance-colors]
name=Elegance Colors Gnome Shell theme (Fedora_20)
type=rpm-md
baseurl=<a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/satya164:/elegance-colors/Fedora_20/">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/satya164:/elegance-colors/Fedora_20/</a>
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=<a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/satya164:/elegance-colors/Fedora_20/repodata/repomd.xml.key">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/satya164:/elegance-colors/Fedora_20/repodata/repomd.xml.key</a>
enabled=1&rsquo; > /etc/yum.repos.d/elegance-colors.repo&rdquo;</p>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Install Theme</h3>

<p><code>bash
sudo yum install gnome-shell-theme-elegance-colors
</code></p>

<h3>Run the Setup</h3>

<p><code>
elegance-colors
</code></p>

<h3>Switch to the Theme</h3>

<p>``` bash
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.user-theme name &lsquo;elegance-colors&rsquo;</p>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Now run the GUI and set it up</h3>

<p>For this you can hit simply search for &lsquo;Elegance Colors&rsquo; from the dash to load the GUI.</p>

<p>In the GUI you have presets and if you want transparency just choose the clear one. After that of course you can customise as you see fit</p>

<h2>Fonts</h2>

<p>To make the most of Fedora, its well worth following <a href="http://worldofgnome.org/how-to-greatly-improve-font-rendering-under-fedora-20/">these instructions</a> to improve font rendering.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have opted to have a customised mobile theme displayed for mobile users of your web site then it can be useful to be able to test this theme from the desktop. This is quite simple to do and there are plugins for most browsers. These days though Chrome users have this functionality built in, and quite nicely as well.</p>

<p>To access a mobile version of a site simply open Chrome and navigate to the site you would like to view in mobile version.</p>

<p>Then hit F12 to bring up the developer tools. Alternatively you can go to the right hand menu and select developer tools under the tools menu. This should bring up a screen looking similar to this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Screenshot-from-2013-06-03-162921-600x475.png"></p>

<p>In the bottom right hand corner of this screen you will see a little cog icon, please click that:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Screenshot-from-2013-06-03-162956.png"></p>

<p>This gives you the overrides menu where you can select the phone you want to emulate. You can also tick the device metrics box so that the displayable area corresponds to that of the phone giving you a good emultation of the phone experience.<img src="/assets/Screenshot-from-2013-06-03-163013-600x354.png"></p>

<p>Tick the box next to User Agent and choose a phone.</p>

<p>Once you have selected the phone you want to emulate under the &ldquo;user agent&rdquo; section and also optionally ticked the box next to &ldquo;Device metrics&rdquo; then you can reload the page (hit [ctrl] + [f5]) and the page will be reloaded and should show you the mobile version of your site.</p>

    <updated>2012-11-28T17:26:39+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/prestashop/extending-a-modules-css-within-a-theme-in-prestashop</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>PrestaShop has a really nice structure for handling all the CSS that will appear in a site. It starts by splitting the CSS so that the CSS is split up per modules. There is a global CSS sheet but this should only be used for things that genuinely appear on all pages.</p>

<p>Extending the CSS of a module in PrestaShop is easy. All you need to do is create a CSS file that matches the naming convention of the module you are looking to extend.</p>

<p>For example if you wanted to change the CSS of the “Wishlist block” module (a.k.a. blockwishlist) in your theme, you would create the file themes/mytheme/css/modules/blockwishlist/blockwishlist.css. This file will then be included on every page that the CSS from the blockwishlist module appears on.</p>

<p>This system is good because it minimises the amount of CSS the browser has to load and also splits the concern of CSS into separate files making it much easier to manage. It also makes adding to a modules CSS with in a theme much easier.</p>

<p>One problem with this method of handling CSS is that by default a PrestaShop site may want the browser to download ten or more individual CSS files which is quite a overhead. Fortunately since PrestaShop 1.4 it has supported CCS merging (referred to as CCC in the admin) which causes the CSS for a page to be merged into a single file on the server to prevent the client having to download tens of CSS files.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Magento Remove Hard Coded URLs from Theme]]></title>
    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-remove-hard-coded-urls-from-theme.html"/>
    <updated>2010-09-02T14:14:18+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-remove-hard-coded-urls-from-theme</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are working on a theme, you may find that there are hard coded links dotted all over the place.</p>

<p>This can make testing a site offline (and thereby not on the same URL) a bit of a pain.</p>

<p>Here is a quick fix for you:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove all hard coded links from the CMS section:</li>
</ol>


<p>```sql</p>

<p>update cms_block set content = replace(content, &lsquo;<a href="http://www.domain.com/">http://www.domain.com/</a>&rsquo;, &lsquo;&rsquo;);</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>```sql</p>

<p>update cms_page set content = replace(content, &lsquo;<a href="http://www.domain.com/">http://www.domain.com/</a>&rsquo;, &lsquo;&rsquo;);</p>

<p>```</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove all hard coded links from the theme files.</li>
</ol>


<p>This is a command line one using grep and sed.</p>

<p>Firstly, cd into the root theme folder</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>cd app/design/frontent/default/hardtheme</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now find files with hard coded links</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>grep -rl &lsquo;<a href="http://www.domain.com">http://www.domain.com</a>&rsquo; ./</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now to automatically remove all those,</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>grep -rl &lsquo;<a href="http://www.domain.com">http://www.domain.com</a>&rsquo; ./ | xargs sed -i &rsquo;s/<a href="http://domain.com//">http://domain.com//</a>&lt;?php echo Mage::getBaseUrl(Mage_Core_Model_Store::URL_TYPE_WEB);?>/'</p>

<p>```</p>
