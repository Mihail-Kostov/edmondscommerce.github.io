    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have switched to Gnome Shell or Gnome 3 then you are no doubt making a lot of use of the overview and alt tab functionality to switch between your windows.</p>

<p>To make this easier (if you have a mouse with extra buttons) you can map your extra buttons to do these actions with a few simple tools.</p>

<p>Firstly you need to install xbindkeys and xdotool</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install xbindkeys xdotool</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>If you need to know your mouse buttons, try running this command:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<p>xev | grep button</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>This will give you a window you can click on with your mouse and it will tell you which button you clicked.</p>

<p>Then finally you need to edit your xbindkeys configuration. This is my xbindkeys config:</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>gnome shell button 8 to alt tab</h1>

<p>&quot;xdotool keydown alt key Tab; sleep 2; xdotool keyup alt&quot;
release + b:8</p>

<h1>gnome shell button 9 to overview</h1>

<p>&quot;xdotool key Super_L&quot;
release + b:9</p>

<p>```</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been working with a server that had been configured differently from the way that I prefer.</p>

<p>The two biggest complaints that I had about it were that the timeout was set very low, meaning that the connection would break off every five minutes, and that vim had been set up so if you selected text using the mouse you could not copy it.</p>

<p>The solutions to these two problems are as follows.</p>

<p>You can tell the terminal not to timeout with the following command</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<p>export TMOUT=0</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Be aware that this will only work for the terminal that you are working with.</p>

<p>The issue with vim is that the mouse was triggering visual mode.</p>

<p>To get round this hold down shift when selecting text and everything will work as expected</p>

    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/git/git-diff-colours-by-default</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you want to make git-diff use colours by default, try running this little command:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<p>echo &lsquo;[color]
 branch = auto
 diff = auto
 status = auto
[color &ldquo;branch&rdquo;]
 current = yellow reverse
 local = yellow
 remote = green
[color &ldquo;diff&rdquo;]
 meta = yellow bold
 frag = magenta bold
 old = red
 new = cyan
[color &ldquo;status&rdquo;]
 added = yellow
 changed = green
 untracked = cyan&rsquo; >> ~/.gitconfig</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Simply copy and paste the above to your command line and hit return.</p>

<p>Then if you run:</p>

<p><code>bash
git diff master..BRANCH
</code></p>

<p>You will get a nice coloured display</p>
