<p>If you get the error:</p>

<p><strong>Got error 28 from storage engine query</strong></p>

<p>When you are trying to access your web site, database or phpMyAdmin then the problem is likely to be that you have run out of hard disk space.</p>

<p>If you have command line access you can quickly check this by running</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>df -h</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>If you do see a partition with low or no space then the solution is simply to find and remove files that are not required and you should be back up and running.</p>

<p>This is as much a note to self as anything else. If you are migrating a Magento store or creating a copy of a store &ndash; if you use phpMyAdmin to create the database dump things can all go wrong.</p>

<p>Instead save yourself the hassle and just use the admin backups functionality. You can then import this using phpMyAdmin without any problems</p>
