    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As if there weren&rsquo;t enough!</p>

<p>There is a new contender for the open source e-commerce crown, a platform called <b><a href="http://sylius.com/features" target="_blank">Sylius</a></b>. The thing that makes this one especially interesting is that rather than being built from scratch it is based upon a very well established PHP framework called Symfony. Some would argue that Symfony is the &ldquo;other&rdquo; PHP framework alongside Zend Framework. In fact there are many frameworks however it would be fair to say that Symfony and Zend Framework are the most well established and up to date.</p>

<p>Basing an e-commerce platform upon an existing PHP framework has many advantages including transferrable skills, established best practice structure and also easier access to a wide range of functionality via library components and extensions.</p>

<p>There is another e-commerce platform based upon a PHP framework. It is based upon Zend Framework &ndash; you might have heard of it &ndash; Magento.</p>

<p>It does look very much like Sylius is still quite a new offering and it can not boast the level of maturity and establishment that Magento has achieved. That said, things move quickly in this industry and who knows what will be top dog in the next five years.</p>

<p>If you are considering Sylius for your e-commerce website and would like to find a UK Sylius developer to work with then do get in touch with Edmonds Commerce today.</p>

<p><a href="http://symfony-reloaded.org/"><a href="http://symfony-reloaded.org/">http://symfony-reloaded.org/</a></a>, a quick run down on the latest version of Symfony.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s looking really good, especially exciting is the promise of massive performance advantages (3 times faster than Zend!).</p>

<p>After a few enquiries, we are looking into the possibility of setting up a Symfony training course based in Leeds in the UK.</p>

<p>At present this is not a firm plan but we are definitely looking into it and would really like some feedback on what kind of Symfony Training course you would like to see.</p>

<p>The course would likely be an introduction to the Symfony PHP framework, possibly going through the Jobeet sample site documentation which represents an excellent training framework.</p>

<p>At this stage it is not totally clear what we would need to include in the course, especially if we can expect candidates to already be familiar and confident with object oriented PHP. One option is that we do another course which is purely focussed on the object oriented aspects of PHP, like a crash course of OO PHP for coders who have no or little experience of this style of coding.</p>

<p>If you are interested and would like to share with us your ideas and expectations for a UK Symfony course please do get in touch. We will take your ideas on board and keep your info on file so we can let you know as and when the course goes live.</p>

<p>My favourite PHP framework of the moment, Symfony, is now moving to my favourite version control system &ndash; Git.</p>

<p>read more about it <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/blog/2010/01/13/symfony-2-migration-to-git">Symfony 2 Migration to Git</a></p>

<p>Its only for the version 2 release, but its a nice step forwards. Github is a really nice system.</p>

<p>The blog post also mentions this great online Git book:</p>

<p><a href="http://progit.org/">Pro Git</a></p>

<p>Not actually come across that before, will be handy.</p>
