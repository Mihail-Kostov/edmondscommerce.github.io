    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the nice features of Gnome Shell is that, with the help of the <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes/">User Theme</a> extension, you can really customise
your desktop experience to be something personalised.</p>

<p>For me, the first thing is to set my desktop background to be a nice picture &ndash; something with wide open spaces, mountains and lots of sky.</p>

<p>The next thing though is to set up a user theme. I like transparency and themes that allow my well chosen background image to shine through.</p>

<p>For this reason I chose the <a href="https://github.com/satya164/elegance-colors">Elegance Colors</a> theme as it has a &ldquo;clear&rdquo; preset which also includes functionality to set the colour scheme based
on the background image which is pretty slick I think.</p>

<p>For installation instructions, please see the <a href="https://github.com/satya164/elegance-colors/blob/master/README.md">README on Github</a></p>

<h2>Quick Fedora instructions are here:</h2>

<h3>Create Repo</h3>

<p>``` bash
sudo sh -c &ldquo; echo &lsquo;[home_satya164_elegance-colors]
name=Elegance Colors Gnome Shell theme (Fedora_20)
type=rpm-md
baseurl=<a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/satya164:/elegance-colors/Fedora_20/">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/satya164:/elegance-colors/Fedora_20/</a>
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=<a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/satya164:/elegance-colors/Fedora_20/repodata/repomd.xml.key">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/satya164:/elegance-colors/Fedora_20/repodata/repomd.xml.key</a>
enabled=1&rsquo; > /etc/yum.repos.d/elegance-colors.repo&rdquo;</p>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Install Theme</h3>

<p><code>bash
sudo yum install gnome-shell-theme-elegance-colors
</code></p>

<h3>Run the Setup</h3>

<p><code>
elegance-colors
</code></p>

<h3>Switch to the Theme</h3>

<p>``` bash
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.user-theme name &lsquo;elegance-colors&rsquo;</p>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Now run the GUI and set it up</h3>

<p>For this you can hit simply search for &lsquo;Elegance Colors&rsquo; from the dash to load the GUI.</p>

<p>In the GUI you have presets and if you want transparency just choose the clear one. After that of course you can customise as you see fit</p>

<h2>Fonts</h2>

<p>To make the most of Fedora, its well worth following <a href="http://worldofgnome.org/how-to-greatly-improve-font-rendering-under-fedora-20/">these instructions</a> to improve font rendering.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Shell Shock is a BASH exploit that can allow the running of arbitrary commands on Linux servers.</p>

<p>This is a newly discovered bug and affects a very large number of servers.</p>

<p>There is a patch, you should ensure that your server&rsquo;s BASH version is updated ASAP.</p>

<h3>Centos, Redhat etc</h3>

<p><code>
yum clean all; yum -y update bash
</code></p>

<h3>Ubuntu, Debian etc</h3>

<p><code>
apt-get install --only-upgrade bash
</code></p>

<p>To check if you are vulnerable, you can run this code:</p>

<p><code>
env X="() { :;} ; echo VULNERABLE" /bin/sh -c "echo completed"
</code></p>

<p>If you see VULNERABLE then you need to update BASH.</p>

    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/Fedora/fedora-live-usb-key-creation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have had continual problems getting most of my USB keys to work as liveusb drives.</p>

<p>This is pretty awkward however it looks like I have now found a solution that works. Instead of using the official Fedora live USB creator, we are going to use something called livecd-iso-to-disk</p>

<p>First of all install it:</p>

<p><code>bash
sudo yum -y install livecd-tools
</code></p>

<p>Then this is your command to create the liveusb. Note you need to set the sdX to whichever your USB key is using, and of course make sure the path to the iso file is correct</p>

<p><code>bash
sudo livecd-iso-to-disk --format --msdos --reset-mbr --overlay-size-mb 512 --home-size-mb 512 ~/Downloads/Fedora-Live-Desktop-x86_64-20-1.iso /dev/sdc
</code></p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As someone who types a lot of text everyday and am generally quite keen not to lose my work, I tend to hit the key combination [Ctrl]+[S] quite a lot.
In fact its almost become muscle memory that every sentence or two I will hit that combination.</p>

<p>When working on a terminal, this can have the unfortunate outcome that the terminal freezes up. For more time than I would like to admit, I thought that this was a Linux bug
And found myself frequently restarting terminal sessions that had locked up.</p>

<p>Then I discovered that you can unlock this when it freezes by hitting [Ctrl]+[Q]. However this is a bit of a pain.</p>

<p>I have now discovered a way of turning off this behaviour completely which is a real relief. Simply add the following to your .bashrc file:</p>

<p>```</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Load testing is something that you really need a decent solution for. A simple tool such as Apache Bench (ab) is overly simplistic for todays web applications.</p>

<p>After some research I decided to use Apache Jmeter as the tool of choice. It is written in Java so easy enough to run on any platform.
It features a GUI which is ideal for creating your tests, then a command line version which is what you should use to run your tests.</p>

<p>For my purposes I wanted to feed in a large list of URLs, for that I followed these instructions:
<a href="http://asciiville.com/musings/coder/how-to-feed-jmeter-from-csv">http://asciiville.com/musings/coder/how-to-feed-jmeter-from-csv</a></p>

<p>This allows you to create a csv file with your choice of URLs. It was actually quite hard to find a decent and succint guide to getting this set up but thankfully that page fitted my requirements.</p>

<p>Once I started to run the test I quickly realised that my system was grinding to a halt with out of memory errors. A bit more searching yielded this page which advises on how to properly run Jmeter including the fact that you really should run it on the command line for proper testing.
