    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For me the use case was a cache directory that I wanted to clear out everything apart from one particular file that was expensive
to create and didn&rsquo;t need to be cleared for my purposes</p>

<p>I decided to add this to my ~/.bashrc file for ease of use in future.</p>

<p>Here is the function</p>

<p>``` bash</p>

<h1>Remove Everything But</h1>

<p>function rmbut(){</p>

<pre><code>local BUT="$@"
ls | grep -v *$BUT* | while read f; do rm -rf $f; done
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>To use the function, simply <code>cd</code> to the directory you want to clear out and then call <code>rmbut MyFileIWantToKeep</code></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have a large database file to import or any other longer running process that involves piping data from one place to another then this little utility should definitely be in your arsenal.</p>

<p>Simply enough you use this to give you a progress indication when you are piping large amounts of data.</p>

<p>To use this on a mysql import (which is where I am most likely to use this) you would do the following:</p>

<p><code>bash
pv ./dumpfile.sql | mysql -u$USER -p$PASS dbname
</code></p>

<p>This will then give you a simple progress bar and very usefully, an ETA that indicates how much time is left For example:
<code>
 308MB 0:07:57 [ 216kB/s] [===============&gt;                                          ] 10% ETA 1:08:32
</code></p>

<p>To install the utility you should first of all just try <code>yum install pv</code>. If that doesn&rsquo;t work then you can read more about installing for your distribution here:

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Often pulling down a Magento or other site you&rsquo;ll find a load of files that have been dumped in the web root. Downloading these is often pointless and takes extra time, so you&rsquo;ll want to exclude them from an rsync (using the <code>--exclude 'path'</code> paramter).</p>

<p>A simple bash command for this is:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<p>du -m &mdash;max-depth=1 &mdash;exclude media | sort -n</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>This invokes <code>du</code> to show each direct subfolder&rsquo;s contents' size, and pipes it through to <code>sort</code> to rank them in increasing size. The sizes are in MB. See <a href="http://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=du+-m+--max-depth%3D1+--exclude+media+|+sort+-n">a more broken down explanation here</a></p>

    <updated>2014-02-10T18:03:36+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/cpanel/cpanel-download-site-files-and-database</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Often a client won&rsquo;t have access to SSH, or won&rsquo;t be able to provide you with some of the more specifics such as FTP, PHPMyAdmin etc. All they know to give you is access to their cPanel. Through this there&rsquo;s various tools at your disposal.</p>

<h2>Try SSH</h2>

<p>Your cPanel login is actually a Linux user login, which cPanel&rsquo;s FTP hooks into. The first step is to navigate in your cPanel to FTP Accounts and click Configure FTP client on a user. These are SFTP details and can very often provide you with SSH shell access, unless the host has disabled this.</p>

<p>Simply try <code>ssh user@host -p 1234</code>, where the user, host and password are your cPanel login, and the port displayed on the FTP Accounts page.</p>

<p>From here you&rsquo;re free to use <code>tar</code>, <code>gzip</code>, <code>mysqldump</code> etc to acquire the files and database.</p>

<h2>If SSH isn&rsquo;t enabled</h2>

<p>Sometimes the host disables SSH access, only allowing its use for SFTP. There are still many ways to acquire the site&rsquo;s files and database:</p>

<h3>Getting hold of the files</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Plain old FTP</strong> &ndash; You can just use an FTP client such as Filezilla to access and download the site&rsquo;s files using FTP or SFTP. This is the simplest way, but can take a long time because of the amount of files involved</li>
<li><strong>File Manager Web UI</strong> &ndash; compressing the site&rsquo;s files obviously shrinks the download size, but also vastly reduces the amount of connections you need to make, leading to a faster download speed.

<ol>
<li> Navigate to the File Manager section (remember to tick &ldquo;Show hidden files&rdquo; to pick up .htaccess files)</li>
<li>Browse to the web root folder, select all the files and folders you want using Ctrl+Click. Remember to exclude unnecessary large files such as sql dumps, media folders and the var folder</li>
<li>Click Compress from the toolbar</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Getting hold of the database</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>PHPMyAdmin</strong> &ndash; PHPMyAdmin offers an array of options for dumping your database. You should start by checking the database&rsquo;s size and considering excluding the dump of tables such as <code>log_url</code>, <code>log_url_info</code>, <code>log_visitor</code>, <code>log_visitor_info</code>, <code>report_viewed_product_index</code>

<ol>
<li> Navigate to the PHPMyAdmin area of cPanel and locate the database in use (check your <code>app/etc/local.xml</code> if you&rsquo;re not sure which</li>
<li>Click the Export tab</li>
<li>Select Custom: here&rsquo;s where you can selectively export information</li>
<li>Tick &lsquo;Disable foreign key checks&rsquo; and set &lsquo;Dump table&rsquo; to &lsquo;structure&rsquo;. This will have PHPMyAdmin set up only the tables' columns but no data (we&rsquo;ll get to that)</li>
<li>Click Go</li>
<li>Once this is complete, navigate back to the Export page and click Custom again.</li>
<li>Deselect (ctrl+click) any tables which are unnecessary</li>
<li>Tick &lsquo;Disable foreign key checks&rsquo; and set &lsquo;Dump table&rsquo; this time to &lsquo;data&rsquo;</li>
<li>This will provide you with two files representing the database. Import first the Structure one, and then the Data one (or concatenate the two together)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/Fedora/getting-skype-working-on-fedora-20.html"/>
    <updated>2014-01-17T14:45:29+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/Fedora/getting-skype-working-on-fedora-20</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently needed to get Skype working on Fedora 20 and unfortunately the process wasn&rsquo;t completely smooth, there were a few hoops I had to jump through.</p>

<p>I am making a note of these here for my own future reference and to help out any one else hitting problems like these.</p>

<p>To install Skype on Fedora 20 64bit, the first thing you need to do is download the <a href="http://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-linux/">Fedora 32bit RPM from Skype</a>.</p>

<p>To install this you should use Yum so that dependancies are handled properly:</p>

<p><code>
sudo yum install ~/Downloads/skype-4.2.0.11-fedora.i586.rpm
</code></p>

<p>However I hit issues around the libvpx package. I have Chromium installed however it packages an incompatible version of libvpx which was blocking the installation.
After a load of messing around the solution for me was so use Yum to remove that package, install the correct package and then install skype.
One issue was that removing the package also removed programs that had it as a dependancy so after installing the correct version of libvpx, I had to reinstall those programs as well.</p>

<p>Here is the process in commands:</p>

<p>Firstly remove the package and install the i686 version
<code>
yum remove libvpx.x86_64
yum install libvpx.i686
</code></p>

<p>Then install Skype
<code>
 yum install ~/Downloads/skype-4.2.0.11-fedora.i586.rpm
</code></p>

<p>Then reinstall the 64 bit version of libvpx
<code>
 yum install libvpx.x86_64
</code></p>

<p>Then reinstall the programs that were removed when I removed libvpx
<code>
 yum install firefox.x86_64 pidgin.x86_64 pidgin-libnotify.x86_64 php-gd.x86_64 shotwell.x86_64 gnome-shell-extension-pidgin.x86_64
</code></p>

<p>That got Skype installed however testing it the audio was terrible. There is one last tweak that fixed this for me:</p>

<p><code>
sudo gnome-open /usr/share/applications/skype.desktop
</code></p>

<p>Change the line that reads <strong>Exec=skype %U</strong> to the following:</p>

<p><strong>Exec=env PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=30 skype %U</strong></p>

<p>Restart Skype and the audio issues should be resolved.</p>
