    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Magento has become aware of a vulnerability requiring patching as soon as possible. The vulnerability allows an attacker to send a specially crafted request to a Magento store and allow it to run Magento code as though it were on the live server. Magento aren&rsquo;t aware of this having been used in the wild, but now that the vulnerability is public, attackers may use it against existing stores.</p>

<p>This vulnerability affects all versions of Magento, and Magento have released patches for versions Community Edition 1.6 to 1.9, and Enterprise 1.11 to 1.14.</p>

<p>The fix is to apply some stricter IP address checks to requests.</p>

<h3>Patching your Magento store</h3>

<p>To get the patch:</p>

<p><em>Note: at time of writing, the Downloads of the CE edition seems to under heavy load and is currently presenting a white page instead of the shell file</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Community Edition</strong> users should go to the <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/download">Magento downloads page</a> and scroll to the &ldquo;Magento Community Edition Patches&rdquo; section. From there, select your version of Magento and click Download</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise Edition</strong> users should log into their Magento account Magento Support Portal</li>
</ul>


<p>You&rsquo;ll be presented with a shell file which will make the necessary changes to your store. Upload this patch to your server in the Magento root and run it against your store.</p>

<p>The patch changes core files, and it&rsquo;s always recommended to test changes on a development copy before the live site, especially if you have modifications to your core code. Also keep in mind that any upgrades pre-1.9.0.1 will remove these changes, and the patch will have to be re-run.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>cd /your/magento/root/</code> &ndash; Navigate to the root of Magento</li>
<li><code>./sh PATCH_SUPEE-5344_CE_1.8.0.0_v1.sh</code> &ndash; Run the patches</li>
<li><code>rm PATCH_SUPEE-5344_CE_1.8.0.0_v1.sh</code> &ndash; Delete the patch file, so that it can&rsquo;t be re-run by the public</li>
<li><code>rm -rf var/cache/*</code> &ndash; Clear Magento&rsquo;s cache</li>
</ol>


<p>Reload a page and the patch will have taken effect.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you run a Magento store or are otherwise familiar with the world of Magento then you have no doubt seen the urgent security patch that live stores needed to apply quickly.</p>

<p>We opted to offer the security patching service for free to our existing clients and then also to the rest of the world. The process of applying the patch is quick and painless thanks to a nice Bash script we put together so there was really no problem in offering this service. <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/magento/magento-security-vulnerability-free-assistance/">You can read all about that offer here</a>. For anyone still not patched, the offer still stands.</p>

<p>Since that time we have had a few nice testimonials which we thought we would share:</p>

<p><b>Chris from Mobile CAD Surveying</b></p>

<blockquote>Thank-you to Edmonds Commerce for highlighting a recent Magento security breach that we were unaware of. Edmonds let us know about this problem and offered to fix it for us at no cost.  We gave them our log in details and within an hour a patch had been installed and everything was working fine.
Thanks once again to Edmonds for their professional service and for attending to this matter very swiftly.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Mark Noble, IT Manager at Buckley Jewellery</b></p>

<blockquote>Buckley Jewellery originally approached Edmonds Commerce to take our existing site and develop it onto a Magento platform.
Since this first project we have used Joseph and his team for a further website and additional work to develop & expand our ecommerce business.
The offer of installing the Magento patch across our websites was typical of a company who provide an honest and refreshing approach to website design.
I would not hesitate to recommend Edmonds Commerce for any ecommerce development and advice.</blockquote>

<p><b>Clare from Libertinesque</b></p>

<blockquote>
I can thoroughly recommend Joseph and his team for such a fantastic service and the security patch which was generously offered as a free service and efficiently applied with a very quick response time. Giving great personal attention every time, I have no hesitation in recommending the team for Magento upgrades and service.

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>!/bin/bash</h1>

<p>if [ ! -f app/Mage.php ]; then
  echo &ldquo;Not in the magento basedir. please run from public_html, httpdocs, www or wherever index.php is.&rdquo;
  exit 99
fi</p>

<p>WGET_BINARY=$(which wget)</p>

<p>if [ &ldquo;&rdquo; = &ldquo;$WGET_BINARY&rdquo; ]; then
  echo &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t find wget in path&hellip; can&rsquo;t continue&rdquo;
  exit 98
fi</p>

<p>MAGENTO_VERSION=$(grep &lsquo;function getVersionInfo()&rsquo; -A6 app/Mage.php | sed s/[^0-9]//g | tr &lsquo;\n&rsquo; &lsquo;.&rsquo; | sed s/&lsquo;..*&rsquo;// | sed s/&lsquo;.$&rsquo;//)
