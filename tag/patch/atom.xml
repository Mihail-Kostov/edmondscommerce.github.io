    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you run a Magento store or are otherwise familiar with the world of Magento then you have no doubt seen the urgent security patch that live stores needed to apply quickly.</p>

<p>We opted to offer the security patching service for free to our existing clients and then also to the rest of the world. The process of applying the patch is quick and painless thanks to a nice Bash script we put together so there was really no problem in offering this service. <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/magento/magento-security-vulnerability-free-assistance/">You can read all about that offer here</a>. For anyone still not patched, the offer still stands.</p>

<p>Since that time we have had a few nice testimonials which we thought we would share:</p>

<p><b>Chris from Mobile CAD Surveying</b></p>

<blockquote>Thank-you to Edmonds Commerce for highlighting a recent Magento security breach that we were unaware of. Edmonds let us know about this problem and offered to fix it for us at no cost.  We gave them our log in details and within an hour a patch had been installed and everything was working fine.
Thanks once again to Edmonds for their professional service and for attending to this matter very swiftly.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Mark Noble, IT Manager at Buckley Jewellery</b></p>

<blockquote>Buckley Jewellery originally approached Edmonds Commerce to take our existing site and develop it onto a Magento platform.
Since this first project we have used Joseph and his team for a further website and additional work to develop & expand our ecommerce business.
The offer of installing the Magento patch across our websites was typical of a company who provide an honest and refreshing approach to website design.
I would not hesitate to recommend Edmonds Commerce for any ecommerce development and advice.</blockquote>

<p><b>Clare from Libertinesque</b></p>

<blockquote>
I can thoroughly recommend Joseph and his team for such a fantastic service and the security patch which was generously offered as a free service and efficiently applied with a very quick response time. Giving great personal attention every time, I have no hesitation in recommending the team for Magento upgrades and service.

<p>For those of you who are comfortable SSHing into your server and running things manually but would like this to be as easy as possible, you can use our bash script to automatically determine which Magento security patch you require and then apply it.</p>

<p>Simply run the following command:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<p>wget -qO- <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/stuff/applysecuritypatch.sh">http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/stuff/applysecuritypatch.sh</a> | /bin/sh</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>!/bin/bash</h1>

<p>if [ ! -f app/Mage.php ]; then
  echo &ldquo;Not in the magento basedir. please run from public_html, httpdocs, www or wherever index.php is.&rdquo;
  exit 99
fi</p>

<p>WGET_BINARY=$(which wget)</p>

<p>if [ &ldquo;&rdquo; = &ldquo;$WGET_BINARY&rdquo; ]; then
  echo &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t find wget in path&hellip; can&rsquo;t continue&rdquo;
  exit 98
fi</p>

<p>MAGENTO_VERSION=$(grep &lsquo;function getVersionInfo()&rsquo; -A6 app/Mage.php | sed s/[^0-9]//g | tr &lsquo;\n&rsquo; &lsquo;.&rsquo; | sed s/&lsquo;..*&rsquo;// | sed s/&lsquo;.$&rsquo;//)
echo &ldquo;Your Magento version is $MAGENTO_VERSION&rdquo;</p>

<p>export $(grep &lsquo;function getVersionInfo()&rsquo; -A6 app/Mage.php | grep = | sed s/,// | sed s/>// | sed s/&lsquo;[\t ]&rsquo;//g | tr &ldquo;a-z&rdquo; &ldquo;A-Z&rdquo; | sed s/^/MAGENTO_/ | sed s/&ldquo;&lsquo;&rdquo;//g)</p>
