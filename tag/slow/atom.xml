    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I upgrade my laptop to the latest release of Linux Mint 14 MATE edition. Everything is working beautifully apart from the wireless which, whilst functional, was cripplingly slow.</p>

<p>After a load of searching and testing, the solution that worked for me was:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<p>sudo -s</p>

<p>iwconfig wlan0 rate 54M</p>

<p>echo &ldquo;options ath9k nohwcrypt=1&rdquo; > /etc/modprobe.d/ath9k.conf</p>

<p>reboot</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>If you copy and paste the above into a terminal it will force the wifi speed to 54M and will make sure hardware crypt is disabled and finally reboot your machine.</p>

<p>I did this and my wifi speed is now perfectly fast, I&rsquo;m a happy bunny :)</p>

<p>If you are finding it takes ages for a password prompt to come up when trying to connect to a CentOS server (and possibly others) this is a solution.</p>

<p>The cause is that your IP address does not have the correct reverse DNS etc settings.</p>

<p>You can of course try to fix all that but if you need a quick fix, you can edit the sshd configuration and disable</p>

<p>GSSAPIAuthentication yes</p>

<p>to: GSSAPIAuthentication no</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>UseDNS yes</p>

<p>to: UseDNS no</p>

<p>If your firefox address bar is getting a bit slow and laggy as it tries to find suggestions, I found one single about:config tweak totally sorted it out for me.</p>

<p>browser.urlbar.search.timeout = 100</p>

<p>change to</p>

<p>browser.urlbar.search.timeout = 10</p>

<p>To do this, open a new tab and type about:config</p>

<p>Then agree to the thing that says you know what you are doing and in the filter bar at the top type:</p>

<p>urlbar.search.timeout</p>

<p>you can then double click on the value (set to 100 by default) and change it to whatever you want. I tried 10 and that seems to work great for me, but you might want to experiment.</p>
