    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are at all involved or exposed to the world of web design and web development then you have no doubt heard of the phrase &ldquo;responsive&rdquo; web design. If you browse the popular theme sites for themes for platforms like WordPress and Magento then you can see responsive themes becoming more popular.</p>

<p>So what does it mean and how does it work?</p>

<h3>What does Responsive Web Design Mean?</h3>


<p>Responsive designs change the layout and visible content on a page depending on the width, height and other factors of the device or window rendering the page. You can generally test out responsive designs by simply unmaximising a browser window and then resizing it down to smaller sizes such as 320 pixels wide. On a normal design you would be quite lucky if the site still rendered in a readable way at that width. More than likely you will only be able to see a fraction of the page and would have to sideways scroll to see the rest of it.</p>

<p>On a responsively designed site, the layout would change as the screen width gets smaller. It might hide certain elements such as side columns and may make things rearrange in a more vertical way to allow them to be displayed without the need for side scrolling.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, this is what responsive web design means.</p>

<h3>How Does Responsive Web Design Work?</h3>


<p>Responsive web design works by using a CSS3 technique called <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/" title="W3C Media Queries Information" target="_blank">Media Queries</a>.</p>

<p>CSS has had the concept of media specific style sheets for quite some time. Traditionally though this was limited to print and screen, allowing for example to remove background images from a page when printing and perhaps adjust font family and size for better printing results.</p>

<p>The media queries functionality extends this concept significantly, allowing custom style rules to be applied based upon a range of differnt media options. The most commonly used of these for responsive web design are width and height.</p>

<p>The full list of properties that can be utilised with media queries include:</p>

<blockquote>width
height
device-width
device-height
orientation
aspect-ratio
device-aspect-ratio
color
color-index
monochrome
resolution
scan
grid</blockquote>

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-merged-css-clear-not-working-solution.html"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are having an issue with Magento and the optional Merge CSS Files (beta) turned on and it not updating with recent CSS changes, you may appreciate this.</p>

<p>Unlike other cached elements that are stored in var/cache, Magento stores the cached and minified CSS files in media/css</p>

<p>If you simply delete the contents of this folder, your CSS changes should kick in as Magento is forced to rebuild these files.</p>

<p>There is an option in cache management to flush CSS storage but for some reason this wasn&rsquo;t working for me. Could be a permissions issue or something else I am not sure, we simply needed to get this change implemented (emergency live site fix) so flushing this folder manually did the trick.</p>

<p>Hope it helps someone else looking for Magento merged CSS clear not working, Magento CSS cache, Magento CSS Files beta</p>
