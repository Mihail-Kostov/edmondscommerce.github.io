    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you create a bash script for a long running process then you may decide its much better, or even essential, that this script is run using screen.</p>

<p>Screen is a utility that allows you to run things in a detachable terminal on the server, so you are not reliant on your own machine maintaining a ssh connection to the server.</p>

<p>A nice trick here is to check if a script is running in screen and die if not</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>echo &ldquo;Running Process in separate screen&rdquo;</p>

<p>if [ -n &ldquo;$STY&rdquo; ];
then</p>

<pre><code>    echo 'We are inside screen';
</code></pre>

<p>else</p>

<pre><code>    echo "Not in a screen, please run with screen"
    exit 1
</code></pre>

<p>fi</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>If you would like your users to be able to spell check their text before they send it and need something more than the browser based spell checking then this could be of interest.</p>

<p>Recently came across this and it looks very impressive:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.phpspellcheck.com/"><a href="http://www.phpspellcheck.com/">http://www.phpspellcheck.com/</a></a></p>

<p>There is a commercial licence for $89 which is a reasonable price I think.</p>

<p>You can download the package and integrate it for free though so you don&rsquo;t need to buy the licence until you decide to deploy it to a commercial site.</p>

<p>To try to help clients who are choosing a hosting platform for Magento, we have modified the already available Magento Check script and extended it to also check for optimisation and some other key requirements.</p>

<p>you can see the script here:</p>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://snipt.net/embed/cf6ca04739bafcd4834dc1b7bfd9b838"></script>


<p>I&rsquo;m using a snipt rather than pasting the code directly in so that if we update it in future, this post should always contain the latest version.</p>
