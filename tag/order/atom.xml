    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s fairly common that you need to add in some custom data to a Magento object.</p>

<p>The most common scenario is products and its totally handled via the admin side. However if you need to extend something like the order object to store custom order information then things get a little bit more tricky, but it&rsquo;s fairly easy still.</p>

<p>If you are extending an order, you also need to make sure that you extend in the &ldquo;flat table&rdquo; way as opposed to the standard EAV way otherwise things won&rsquo;t work as you expect.</p>

<p>If you just want to add in a simple text attribute then you can do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Edit your config.xml and set up the installer section, the following needs to be within the</li>
</ol>


<p><code>xml
&lt;global&gt;&lt;/global&gt;
</code>
 tags</p>

<p>```xml</p>

<!-- RESOURCES - Install etc //-->


<pre><code>    &lt;resources&gt;
        &lt;custommodule_setup&gt;
            &lt;setup&gt;
                &lt;module&gt;EdmondsCommerce_CustomModule&lt;/module&gt;
                &lt;!--
                    Points to
                    app/code/local/EdmondsCommerce_CustomModule/sql/custommodule_setup/mysql4-install-0.0.1.php

                    Sets mysql4-install-0.1.0.php to be a class of type Mage_Sales_Model_Mysql4_Setup
                    Passes 'core_setup' as a connection 'type' :)
                --&gt;
                &lt;class&gt;Mage_Sales_Model_Mysql4_Setup&lt;/class&gt;
            &lt;/setup&gt;
            &lt;connection&gt;
                &lt;use&gt;core_setup&lt;/use&gt;
            &lt;/connection&gt;
        &lt;/custommodule_setup&gt;
    &lt;/resources&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Note this bit:
<class>Mage_Sales_Model_Mysql4_Setup</class></p>

<p>Its important you specify the correct setup model for the object you are extending. Just take a look at the core module config.xml file to find out. In the above example we are setting up to extend the order object which uses the flat table storage system.</p>

<ol>
<li>Your installer file
app/code/local/EdmondsCommerce/CustomModule/sql/custommodule_setup/mysql4-install-0.1.0.php</li>
</ol>


<p>```php</p>

<p>&lt;?php
/<em> @var $installer Mage_Sales_Model_Mysql4_Setup </em>/
$installer = $this;</p>

<p>$installer->startSetup();</p>

<p>/<strong>
* Adds an attribute of the code custommodule_info to the order object
* As this is a flat table, it adds the column to the table for you
</strong>/
$installer->addAttribute(&lsquo;order&rsquo;, &lsquo;custommodule_info&rsquo;, array(&lsquo;type&rsquo;=>&lsquo;text&rsquo;));</p>

<p>$installer->endSetup();</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Then access any Magento page and your installer should run and update the schema for you.</p>

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-add-order-status-history-comment.html"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Adding an order status history comment to a Magento order object is easy, when you know how!</p>

<p>There is a very helpful Mage_Sales_Model_Order::addStatusHistoryComment() method which will take a comment and optional order status and either just save the comment or save the comment and update the order status.</p>

<p>However I found that it didn&rsquo;t quite work for me. Reading the docblock on the Mage_Sales_Model_Order::addStatusHistory() method, it turns out that it won&rsquo;t take effect unless the order object itself is saved.</p>

<p>So in a nutshell this is how to add a comment to an order in Magento</p>

<p>OpenERP is a fully featured enterprise class open source ERP system that thanks to it&rsquo;s modular structure can support all kinds of business models and requirements ranging from Retail to E-Commerce to Manufacturing to Services and beyond.</p>

<p>OpenERP is written in a language called Python, widely regarded as an excellent language thanks to it&rsquo;s power, cross platform compatibility and ease of development.</p>

<p>Thanks to being open source, you can experiment or even implement OpenERP for you business without any up front costs, licence costs, vendor lock in or any of the other big drawbacks of standard paid for ERP packages.</p>

<p>This means you can dip your toe in the water initially and roll out further integration and functionality as you are ready for it and your business requires it.</p>

<p>There is a wide global network of specialist agencies supporting the OpenERP package and at it&rsquo;s centre is a large development house based in Belgium that is entirely devoted to the platform. This kind of business backed open source package is great news for you because it ensures that there will be professional support and training available and you can expect the platform to continue developing in the future, making it an excellent platform to invest into.</p>

<p>This is similar to the way that Magento, our most highly recommended open source ecommerce package, is backed by Varien &ndash; a large and well funded company that is pushing the platform and really making it an enterprise class platform.</p>

<p>Of course the logical best of breed combination is to use the awesome front end functionality of Magento for your e-commerce stores and hook this into OpenERP&rsquo;s excellent business management functionality.</p>
