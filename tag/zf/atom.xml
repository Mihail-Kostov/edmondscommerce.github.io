    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are having issues running unit tests that work with sessions and call session_start(), you might see error messages like this:</p>

<p><strong>output started at &ldquo;PHPUnit/Util/Printer.php:173&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>If you do, the solution is fairly simple. Just add the flag &mdash;stderr to PHPUnit eg</p>

<p>```</p>

<p> phpunit &mdash;stderr mytest.php</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>If you are using Netbeans, you simply need to add this to your PHPUnit script setting in</p>

<p>Tools->Options->PHP->Unit Test</p>

<p>eg /opt/lampp/bin/phpunit &mdash;stderr</p>

This is a post that was written a long time ago and is only being kept here for posterity.
You should probably look up more recent blog posts related to the subject you are researching

<p>Currently working on a big Zend Framework project so I though I would have a breather and do a little blog post targeted at anyone looking for a UK based Zend Framework developer.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve built a few Zend Framework based systems and have found it a fun system to work with, especially on the more recent versions of the library. There have been a few hurdles along the way and I have definitely improved my object oriented PHP development skills a lot since I first had a go at the <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a> quick start way back when.</p>

<p>I chose to learn <strong>Zend Framework</strong> primarily because Magento is based on it, and Magento is the ecommerce platform that I have chosen to specialise in. Since then though I have found that Zend Framework has a definite place for me, especially when coding more heavy duty data processing applications.</p>

<p>For simple web sites I would tend more towards using Symfony or my own lightweight MVC framework for very simple sites. For me Zend Framework really shines when you need to do something a little different that doesn&rsquo;t easily fit into the mold specified by the Symfony code creation tools.</p>

<p>So to conclude, if you are looking for a PHP web developer who specialises in Zend Framework and particularly if you would prefer a UK based Zend Framework specialist then <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/contact-about-zend-framework.html">get in touch with us today</a>.</p>
