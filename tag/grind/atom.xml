    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Magento profiler is useful when you are trying to discover what potential bottlenecks are in place in a specific Magento implementation that are slowing down the performance of the site. Often when doing this kind of analysis you might find that a particular block or extension is responsible for more than 70% of the total page load time. At this point you would choose to either optimise, cache or disable the block altogether to remove this performance bottleneck and improve page speed significantly.</p>

<p>If you have ever tried to use Magento&rsquo;s built in profiler you will no doubt agree with Fabrizio&rsquo;s comments that, when you have it working, the output is hard to read and not really very useful in terms of seeing what is actually going on.</p>

<p>To aid with this process and give us a nice colourful and friendly user interface to the Magento profiler, Fabrizio has built a Magento module that extends the default profiler and makes it a much more useful tool.</p>

<p>You can download the extension from <a href="https://github.com/fbrnc/Aoe_Profiler" title="Magento Aoe Profiler on Git Hub" target="_blank">git hub here</a>.</p>

<p>Read the full blog story <a href="http://www.fabrizio-branca.de/magento-profiler.html" title="Fabrizio Branch blog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
