    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Log files are probably the single most useful item on a web server when it comes to debugging. They are packed full of all the information you need to understand what is
happening on the server and detect any potential issues.</p>

<p>Reading log files by hand is basically imposssible for any meaningful overall monitoring. You can of course do some grepping and other bash tools to gain more insights but some times it&rsquo;s nice to just have a simple tool.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of tools like top, mytop, apachetop and ngxtop. GoAccess is a little bit different though, mainly it just seems a lot more fully featured.</p>

<p>Best thing to do is to try it. Here is how to install it on CentoOS</p>

<p>``` bash
yum install ncurses-devel glib2-devel geoip-devel
mkdir -p ~/goaccess
cd ~/goaccess
wget <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/goaccess/0.7.1/goaccess-0.7.1.tar.gz">http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/goaccess/0.7.1/goaccess-0.7.1.tar.gz</a>
tar -xzvf goaccess-0.7.1.tar.gz
cd goaccess-0.7.1/
./configure &mdash;enable-geoip &mdash;enable-utf8
make
make install</p>

<p>```</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are tearing your hair out trying to figure out why you are not able to log into the Magento admin on some browsers then this might be your solution.</p>

<p>This solution will apply particularly if you are setting up Magento on a brand new server or VPS as you will see.</p>

<p>The problem is actually that the server time is wrong. The server time is used for generating cookies and the fact that the time is wrong means that cookies become invalidated immediately. Some browsers will deal with this in a less aggressive way than others and might actually let the cookie work, others will go for hard line security and will make the whole thing break.</p>

<p>The way to check this is to SSH into the server and check the time:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<p>date</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>If the time is wrong then you need to do the following to fix it:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<p>yum install ntp
chkconfig ntpd on
ntpdate pool.ntp.org
/etc/init.d/ntpd start</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>The above will install NTP, make it run on startup, will update the time and will set it running so the time should stay up to date from here on.</p>

<p>To check that has worked simply check the time again:
```bash</p>

<p>date</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Then finally flush your Magento cache and sessions</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<p>rm -rf var/cache/<em>
rm -rf var/sessions/</em></p>

<p>```</p>

<p>And you should be good to go</p>
