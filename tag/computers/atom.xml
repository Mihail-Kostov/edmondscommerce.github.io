<p>We have recently finished a nice Magento upgrade project for our client Project M who is based in Australia. ProjectM specializes in selling computer accessories and also computer games.</p>

<p>This particular project involved upgrading the site to the latest Magento (v1.5.1.0) from version 1.3.1.1 and also to install a new template while ensuring all important features from the previous template remained functional.</p>

<p>We also worked on upgrading/fixing old extensions plus installing new ones as per requirement.</p>

<p>Despite challenges especially from the size of the database the project was nice to work on. To view the entire site please click here to <a href='http://www.projectm.com.au/'>visit ProjectM</a></p>
