    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here at Edmonds Commerce we are always looking for new techniques and tools that allow to speed up and ease our internal work-flow which results in faster and more<a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/web-project-management/guidelines-of-effective-web-project-workflow/" title="Guidelines of Effective Web Project Management" target="_blank"> effective project planning</a>, management and development. We love to involve and closely collaborate with our clients as much as possible.</p>

<p>Just found this awesome c<a href=" http://www.invisionapp.com/" title="Invisionapp - cross platform prototyping tool" target="_blank">ross-platform mockup and interactive prototyping tool &ndash; Invision</a> &ndash; which has an amazing feedback feature which could replace long email conversations. It is filled with lots of  active guides and how-to&rsquo;s which makes it really understandable for clients. Actually, I find this part the most important about all the application. So far there have been a serious struggle with this particular phase &ndash; work showoff, iterations and final sign off. That is a long journey for traditional email conversations.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent just a few moments with it, but it looks like 135.004 people in 70 countries aren&rsquo;t trusting this awesome tool just for fun. (as it is stated on <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/" title="invisionapp homepage" target="_blank">invisionapp homepage</a> when writing this post) Feels like I&rsquo;ve finally found a well designed tool which has the most of the essential features.</p>

<p>Looking forward to take our clients on the journey of designing and iterating on their projects.</p>

<p>Got my hands on these two marvellous responsive design tools from Adobe &ndash; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/EdgeReflow" title="Adobe Edge Reflow Homepage" target="_blank">Edge Reflow</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/EdgeInspect‎" title="Adboe Edge Inspect" target="_blank">Edge Inspect</a>.</p>

<p>Although Reflow is still in Beta, it has brilliant concept. Never the less <u>it has a potential to redefine the way of how we create and test responsive designs</u> once and for all. A much more effective way. It actually allows you to visualise everything blazing fast by adding different break points and adjusting the layout and design for each of them. Going further &ndash; you can test that right away on most of the devices with Edge Inspect. It&rsquo;s that dead easy &ndash; just install the app and connect your phone or tablet with your computer to see how the design actually works on the target device.</p>

<p>There are plenty of good resources available that will get you started in no time. The effort of learning it is definitely worth every minute you spend. The most useful resource that I&rsquo;ve found so far is the <a href="http://http://www.adobe.com/devnet/edge-reflow/articles/edge-reflow-getting-started.html" title="Edge Reflow Guide for Beginners" target="_blank">original Edge Reflow guide from Adobe itself</a> It is a beginner level guide. Once you understand the core principles everything else is dead easy.</p>

<p>Remember, that it is still in beta. Let&rsquo;s help Adobe team to create more remarkable products and post our ideas of improvements it <a href="http://forums.adobe.com/community/edge_reflow_preview?view=idea" title="Edge Reflow Forum" target="_blank">Edge Reflow forum.</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/assets/ProtoIO.png"></p>

<p>As a designer who is keen on usability and user centric, well tested web systems I was in a desperate need of silly fast and useful mobile prototyping system. Up until recently I’ve used paper prototyping and later uploading images on various smart phones (always struggling with inaccurate representation of actual interface size, look and feel of the interactions).</p>

<p>Thankfully, that is the past and the future holds much brighter and functional solution for <a href="https://proto.io/" title="Proto.io - Rapid fast mobile prototyping" target="_blank">rapid fast mobile prototyping thanks to Proto.io </a></p>

<p>I see that they have been around for a while, which only brings lots of benefits to us – usability testers and designers. Prototyping application interface is improved and it has some really good functionality, although there is still room to grow like to support keyboard commands, more tutorials and find a way of making the overall work flow more intuitive as I found it hard to get into. Thankfully, proto.io team has created video tutorials for some of the most important questions.</p>

<p>Once I got the basic idea and figured out some work-arounds, I was able to upload my mobile site design in the application and create a working prototype. It is awesome, how fast and easy it is to test the prototypes on various devices. The most important feature I found is that I can access the fully working prototype from whatever device.</p>

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/adding-confirm-e-mail-address-field-to-magento-frontend-forms.html"/>
    <updated>2012-01-21T16:44:43+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/adding-confirm-e-mail-address-field-to-magento-frontend-forms</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are thinking of adding a confirmation of e-mail address to the front-end registration pages of your store e.g the Checkout billing page or the customer account registration, the little snippets below could be of use to you</p>

<p><strong>For the Checkout billing page</strong>
1. Locate the magento checkout billing page (billing.phtml) which can be found in  app/design/frontend/default/&lt;package_name>/template/checkout/onepage
2. Add code 1 below where situable;
<strong>Code 1</strong>
```html</p>

<p><div class="field">
<label for="billing:confirm_email" class="required"><em>*</em>&lt;?php echo $this-><strong>(&lsquo;Confirm Email Address&rsquo;) ?></label>
<div class="input-box">
<input type="text" name="billing[confirm_email]" title="<?php echo $this-></strong>(&lsquo;Confirm Email&rsquo;) ?>&ldquo; id="billing:confirm_email&rdquo; class=&ldquo;input-text required-entry validate-cemail&rdquo; />
</div></p>

<p><code>
For the validation of this email confirmation field with the actual email field
3. Locate the Javascript file which Magento uses for validation (validation.js) in /js/prototype
4. Add code 3 where suitable e.g immediately after this line(code 2) in validation.js
&lt;strong&gt;Code 2&lt;/strong&gt;
</code>javascript</p>

<p>return !(pass.length &lt; 7);</p>

<pre><code>}],
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p><strong>Code 3</strong>
```javascript</p>

<p>[&lsquo;validate-cemail&rsquo;, &lsquo;Please make sure your emails match.&rsquo;, function(v) {
var conf = $$(&lsquo;.validate-cemail&rsquo;)[0];
var pass = false;
if ($(&lsquo;email&rsquo;)) {
pass = $(&lsquo;email&rsquo;);
}
var emailElements = $$(&lsquo;.validate-email&rsquo;);
for (var i = 0; i &lt; emailElements.size(); i++) {
var emailElement = emailElements[i];
if (emailElement.up(&lsquo;form&rsquo;).id == conf.up(&lsquo;form&rsquo;).id) {
pass = emailElement;
}
}
if ($$(&lsquo;.validate-admin-email&rsquo;).size()) {
pass = $$(&lsquo;.validate-admin-email&rsquo;)[0];
}
return (pass.value == conf.value);
}],</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Then that should just do exactly what you want.</p>

<p><strong>For the Customer Account Registration page</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Locate the magento account register page ,register.phtml in
app/design/frontend/&lt;package_name>/default/template/persistent/customer/form/</li>
<li>Include code 4 where suitable
<strong>Code 4</strong>
```html</li>
</ol>


<p><div class="field">
<label for="confirm_email" class="required"><em>*</em>&lt;?php echo $this-><strong>(&lsquo;Confirm Email Address&rsquo;) ?></label>
<div class="input-box">
<input type="text" name="confirm_email" title="<?php echo $this-></strong>(&lsquo;Confirm Email&rsquo;) ?>&ldquo; id="confirm_email&rdquo; class=&ldquo;input-text required-entry validate-cemail&rdquo; />
</div>
</div></p>

<p>```</p>

<p>After this, you should have another field on your registration page which can be subjected to any styling you need to do, most importantly when styling do not change the tag id&rsquo;s and class names, in a situation where you need to change them, you must also change the javascript selectors accordingly.</p>

<p>I hope this works for you.</p>
