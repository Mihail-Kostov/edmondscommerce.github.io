    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Magento has become aware of a vulnerability requiring patching as soon as possible. The vulnerability allows an attacker to send a specially crafted request to a Magento store and allow it to run Magento code as though it were on the live server. Magento aren&rsquo;t aware of this having been used in the wild, but now that the vulnerability is public, attackers may use it against existing stores.</p>

<p>This vulnerability affects all versions of Magento, and Magento have released patches for versions Community Edition 1.6 to 1.9, and Enterprise 1.11 to 1.14.</p>

<p>The fix is to apply some stricter IP address checks to requests.</p>

<h3>Patching your Magento store</h3>

<p>To get the patch:</p>

<p><em>Note: at time of writing, the Downloads of the CE edition seems to under heavy load and is currently presenting a white page instead of the shell file</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Community Edition</strong> users should go to the <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/download">Magento downloads page</a> and scroll to the &ldquo;Magento Community Edition Patches&rdquo; section. From there, select your version of Magento and click Download</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise Edition</strong> users should log into their Magento account Magento Support Portal</li>
</ul>


<p>You&rsquo;ll be presented with a shell file which will make the necessary changes to your store. Upload this patch to your server in the Magento root and run it against your store.</p>

<p>The patch changes core files, and it&rsquo;s always recommended to test changes on a development copy before the live site, especially if you have modifications to your core code. Also keep in mind that any upgrades pre-1.9.0.1 will remove these changes, and the patch will have to be re-run.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>cd /your/magento/root/</code> &ndash; Navigate to the root of Magento</li>
<li><code>./sh PATCH_SUPEE-5344_CE_1.8.0.0_v1.sh</code> &ndash; Run the patches</li>
<li><code>rm PATCH_SUPEE-5344_CE_1.8.0.0_v1.sh</code> &ndash; Delete the patch file, so that it can&rsquo;t be re-run by the public</li>
<li><code>rm -rf var/cache/*</code> &ndash; Clear Magento&rsquo;s cache</li>
</ol>


<p>Reload a page and the patch will have taken effect.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Shell Shock is a BASH exploit that can allow the running of arbitrary commands on Linux servers.</p>

<p>This is a newly discovered bug and affects a very large number of servers.</p>

<p>There is a patch, you should ensure that your server&rsquo;s BASH version is updated ASAP.</p>

<h3>Centos, Redhat etc</h3>

<p><code>
yum clean all; yum -y update bash
</code></p>

<h3>Ubuntu, Debian etc</h3>

<p><code>
apt-get install --only-upgrade bash
</code></p>

<p>To check if you are vulnerable, you can run this code:</p>

<p><code>
env X="() { :;} ; echo VULNERABLE" /bin/sh -c "echo completed"
</code></p>

<p>If you see VULNERABLE then you need to update BASH.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is being reported that there has been a database breach at eBay leading to the leaking of encrypted passwords</p>

<p>Whilst there has not been any reported access to user accounts it is worth updating your password for eBay and any other site that share the same password</p>

<p>It is considered bad practice to have the same password for multiple site, so to help me keep track of all of them I use <a href="https://lastpass.com">lastpass</a> to make the job simpler</p>

<p>The full statement for ebay is available <a href="http://www.ebayinc.com/in_the_news/story/ebay-inc-ask-ebay-users-change-passwords">here</a></p>

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/security/nhs-website-hosting-malware.html"/>
    <updated>2014-02-03T10:39:41+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/security/nhs-website-hosting-malware</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning I was made aware that certain pages of the NHS website &ndash; the UK&rsquo;s National Health Service &ndash; were hosting malware that was automatically redirecting users to malicious pages. The story broke on the popular news site Reddit, you can see the actual reddit thread <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1wv91h/nhsuk_compromised_many_pages_are_serving_malware/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The first and most important point is that if you ever find yourself unexpectedly redirected from a page to another page then you should definitely not agree to install any software suggsted by the redirected site. Your safest course of action is likely to close the tab or even your browser as soon as possible and then run a full virus scan after updating your virus software.</p>

<h3>Here is some information on this particular attack</h3>

<p>The list of URLs originally shown to be hosting this malware can be found <a href="http://pastebin.com/DbvR0iyj">here</a>.</p>

<p>The attack vector seems to be in a (possibly accidental) mis spelling of the domain name that is hosting some Javascript related to Google Translate.</p>

<h4>You can see a correct chunk of HTML here:</h4>

<p>``` html</p>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/includes/AC_RunActiveContent.js"></script>


<script type="text/javascript" src="http://edmondscommerce.github.io//translate.google.com/translate_a/element.js?cb=googleTranslateElementInit"></script>


<p><link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" charset="UTF-8" href="https://translate.googleapis.com/translate_static/css/translateelement.css"><script type="text/javascript" charset="UTF-8" src="https://translate.googleapis.com/translate_static/js/element/main.js"></script></p>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/includes/translate.js"></script>


<p>```</p>

<h4>And here is the compromised HTML</h4>

<p>``` html</p>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://edmondscommerce.github.io//translate.google.com/translate_a/element.js?cb=googleTranslateElementInit"></script>


<script type="text/javascript" src="http://edmondscommerce.github.io//translate.googleaspis.com/translate_static/js/element/19/element_main.js"></script>


<script type="text/javascript" src="http://edmondscommerce.github.io//translate.googleaspis.com/translate_static/js/element/element.js"></script>


<script type="text/javascript" src="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/includes/translate.js"></script>


<p>```</p>

<p>The domain name googleaspis.com is registered by regtons.com and though the <a href="http://www.whois.com/whois/googleaspis.com">Whois information</a> has the actual domain ownership details obfuscated by a Czech company that protect the actual real ownership details, it does seem that the server and other <a href="http://www.tcpiputils.com/browse/ip-address/31.170.179.179">internet services</a> are all based in the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>Checking the Google Safe Browsing information, you can see that Google have found <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=hmr.nhs.uk/">numerous issues</a> on the NHS domains seemingly starting on the 31st of January this year.</p>

<p>It seems that the NHS have now confirmed that they are aware of this issue and are currently taking action to resolve the problem.</p>

<p>It is still not clear exactly how or why this issue cropped up in the first place. If it was an accident, how did it manage to get past what you would expect to be quite rigorous quality assurance processes? If this was a result of a malicious break in, how did they manage to compromise the website in this way and are there any further security issues that we should, as a nation, be worried about?</p>
