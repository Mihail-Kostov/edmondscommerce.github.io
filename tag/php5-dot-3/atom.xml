<p>Just got a heads up about a bug with PHP 5.3 and windows.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t actually use windows but on the off chance that I might in the future for some reason I thought I would make a note of the solution here.</p>

<p>The problem can be spotted by getting this error message:</p>

<p><b>PHP Warning: mysqli::mysqli(): ```2002
 A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not (trying to connect via tcp://localhost:3306) in xxx.php on line 2
PHP Warning: mysqli::mysqli(): (HY000/2002): A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.
in xxx.php on line 2</b></p>

<p>The solution is this:</p>

<p>Edit your hosts file and comment out the Ipv6 line</p>

<p>[code]#::1 localhost
```</p>
