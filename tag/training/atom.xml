    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just ran our Magento training course last week and despite some technical issues at the start of the day I think it was a great success. By the end of the day the delegates all knew their Attribute Sets from their Attribute Groups, could set up layered navigation, create configurable products the fastest way possible without using spreadsheets and generally had a good grounding to go and make the most out of their Magento web shops.</p>

<p>If you are interested in doing some Magento training, we have more course coming up all the time, just give us a call on <strong>0844 357 0201</strong> or drop as a line via our <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/contact-us/">contact form</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just finished my first delivery of a Zend PHP course module. It was the databases section of the higher structures course. Everyone seemed to enjoy it and I think it went really well. Its great to be able to help newcomers to PHP to get a better understanding of the language and see the power and flexibility that it offers.</p>
