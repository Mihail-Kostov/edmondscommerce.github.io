    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a current vulnerability with skype accounts where anyone who knows your email address can get access to your account, and even your private chat logs.</p>

<p>According to Kaspersky Labs (a leading computer security firm), the leader of the Russian Opposition has had his private chat logs leaked via this method.</p>

<p>This is a serious vulnerability and Microsoft (the current owners of skype) are looking into the issue.  At present there&rsquo;s no way to avoid the compromise, perhaps think about clearing your logs if you have anything private in there.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a good article <a title="The Register" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/14/skype_disables_password_reset_bug/" target="_blank">here</a> that explains in more detail.</p>

<p>Looks like Google have finally rolled out Google Voice to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>A nice alternative to skype, the rates look fairly reasonable though not as cheap as Skype &ndash; in fact the only place it seems to beat skype is on calling the US.</p>
