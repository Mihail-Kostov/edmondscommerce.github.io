<p>Edmonds Commerce specialise in <strong>Magento Ecommerce</strong> and are available for <strong>Freelance Magento</strong> projects and installations. If you are looking to set up a new ecommerce venture and are considering using Magento &ndash; get in touch today.</p>

<p>Magento is certainly making waves. For those of you who haven&rsquo;t heard of it, Magento is looking likely to become the successor to osCommerce as the most popular open source ecommerce platform.</p>

<p>There are many things which make Magento a much better option than osCommerce. However for some people the tried and tested, &lsquo;better the devil you know&rsquo;, huge knowledge, customisation and support base of osCommerceÂ  makes it the platform they would still prefer to put their development investment into.</p>

<p>These justifications are valid to a point, however I now believe that the time is right to move into Magento and whilst I am not certain that it is worth worrying about upgrading if you already have a perfectly functional osCommerce site, I would recommend anyone looking to set up a new ecommerce site takes a close look at Magento.</p>
