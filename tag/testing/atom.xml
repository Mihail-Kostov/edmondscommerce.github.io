<p>As a designer who is keen on usability and user centric, well tested web systems I was in a desperate need of silly fast and useful mobile prototyping system. Up until recently I’ve used paper prototyping and later uploading images on various smart phones (always struggling with inaccurate representation of actual interface size, look and feel of the interactions).</p>

<p>Thankfully, that is the past and the future holds much brighter and functional solution for <a href="https://proto.io/" title="Proto.io - Rapid fast mobile prototyping" target="_blank">rapid fast mobile prototyping thanks to Proto.io </a></p>

<p>I see that they have been around for a while, which only brings lots of benefits to us – usability testers and designers. Prototyping application interface is improved and it has some really good functionality, although there is still room to grow like to support keyboard commands, more tutorials and find a way of making the overall work flow more intuitive as I found it hard to get into. Thankfully, proto.io team has created video tutorials for some of the most important questions.</p>

<p>Once I got the basic idea and figured out some work-arounds, I was able to upload my mobile site design in the application and create a working prototype. It is awesome, how fast and easy it is to test the prototypes on various devices. The most important feature I found is that I can access the fully working prototype from whatever device.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you ever used Webmaster Tools in Firefox but have now switched to using Chrom(e|ium) instead then you probably miss the form filler &ndash; especially if you ever need to test checkouts or other form intensive web site user stories.</p>

<p>A nice little extension that I just discovered takes care of this, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cbpplldpcdcfejdaldmnfhlodoadjhii" target="_blank">Chrome Form Fuzzer</a>.</p>

<p>You can configure it for simple form filling or with a little creative configuration it could easily be used for security testing and more in depth testing to ensure that input is being sanitised and filtered properly.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Virtualbox is an amazing tool for testing and developing on various systems.</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s even easier as there is a nicely organised repository of clean VirtualBox images you can download and get running with in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p><a href="http://virtualboxes.org/"><a href="http://virtualboxes.org/">http://virtualboxes.org/</a></a></p>

<p>We are going to use them for some <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk">Magento</a> performance optimisation testing on various platforms as we perfect our <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/magento/magento-optimised-hosting/">Magento Server Optimisation</a> skills and try to benchmark some new ideas.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When using PHPUnit with xampp the first the to do is install PHPUnit through pear. You usually need to update pear first, after that you should be able to follow the instructions <a href="http://pear.phpunit.de/">here</a></p>

<p>Getting PHPUnit working with Magento is fairly straight forward. It&rsquo;s just a case of including Mage.php and then calling Mage::app(); in the setup method of your test class:</p>

<p>```php
&lt;?php</p>

<p>require_once &lsquo;../app/Mage.php&rsquo;;</p>

<p>class TemplateTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase {</p>

<pre><code>public function setUp() {
    Mage::app();
}

public function testExample() {
    $helper = Mage::helper('core');
    $this-&gt;assertTrue($helper instanceof Mage_Core_Helper_Data, "Magento isn't running!");
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>If you use NetBeans as your IDE you&rsquo;ll be glad to know that it has support for running your tests directly without having to use a terminal. This does require a bit of configuration. You need to tell NetBeans where the PHPUnit script is under Tools > Options > PHP > Unit Testing. If you are using it with XAMPP it will be located at /opt/lampp/bin/phpunit. To begin running the tests you then go Run > Test Project and NetBeans will ask you where your tests are. After that you will get a &ldquo;Test File&rdquo; source folder in the Projects pane. You can now right click each test file and choose &ldquo;Run file&rdquo; and netbeans will run it. If you have xdebug setup the debug option also works nicely.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="oldpost"><h4>This is an old post. The information it contains is probably out of date or innacurate</h4>
<p>
This is a post that was written a long time ago and is only being kept here for posterity.
You should probably look up more recent blog posts related to the subject you are researching
</p>
</div>


<p>If you need to test your code against the (ahem) interesting interpretations of the various iterations of Internet Explorer then this is a great resource for you.</p>

<p>Turns out Microsoft have thrown web devs a bone by offering free virtual machine images with the various IE/OS flavours for you to test on. You can download them <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=11575">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you use VirtualBox and also a *nix based operating system such as Linux or OSX then you can use <a href="https://github.com/xdissent/ievms">this, frankly awesome, bash script</a> to automatically download one or all of these machines and fully set them up in VirtualBox for you.</p>

<p>VirtualBox, if you are not aware, is a freely available Virtualisation platform allowing you to run other operating systems on your desktop. On todays powerful machines its perfectly easy to run Linux as your core operating system and then for either running windows only apps or for testing dodgy browsers, you can fire up one of these VMs.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that they are not for keeps, you will need to reset them every 30 days due to the fact that they can not be activated. For our purposes though this is not really a problem.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>


<p>Please note all of this has been copied and pasted from <a href="http://www.webupd8.org/2011/09/test-websites-in-internet-explorer-9-8.html">here</a>. Posted here for reference only, all original attribution and credit goes to webupd8.</p>

<ol>
<li>Before proceeding, make sure you have the latest VirtualBox installed &ndash; you can find Ubuntu installation instructions HERE. You&rsquo;ll also need &ldquo;curl&rdquo; (for both Linux and OSX) and &ldquo;unrar&rdquo; (Linux only). In Ubuntu, install them using the command below:
```</li>
</ol>


<p>sudo apt-get install curl unrar</p>

<p>```</p>

<ol>
<li>To download and run the CODE, use the following command in a terminal:
```</li>
</ol>


<p>curl -s <a href="https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh">https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh</a> | bash</p>

<p>```
If you want to check out the bash source before running it, you can find it @ GitHub.</p>

<p>The above command will download Windows WHDs for IE7, IE8 and IE9. If you only need one Internet Explorer version, you can run:
```</p>

<p>curl -s <a href="https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh">https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh</a> | IEVMS_VERSIONS=&ldquo;9&rdquo; bash</p>

<p>```
Where &ldquo;9&rdquo; is the IE version you want (you can also add two versions here, like &ldquo;7 9&rdquo;).</p>

<p>At this point, the download should start and it will take a while so be patient.</p>
