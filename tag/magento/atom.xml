    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Often a client won&rsquo;t have access to SSH, or won&rsquo;t be able to provide you with some of the more specifics such as FTP, PHPMyAdmin etc. All they know to give you is access to their cPanel. Through this there&rsquo;s various tools at your disposal.</p>

<h2>Try SSH</h2>

<p>Your cPanel login is actually a Linux user login, which cPanel&rsquo;s FTP hooks into. The first step is to navigate in your cPanel to FTP Accounts and click Configure FTP client on a user. These are SFTP details and can very often provide you with SSH shell access, unless the host has disabled this.</p>

<p>Simply try <code>ssh user@host -p 1234</code>, where the user, host and password are your cPanel login, and the port displayed on the FTP Accounts page.</p>

<p>From here you&rsquo;re free to use <code>tar</code>, <code>gzip</code>, <code>mysqldump</code> etc to acquire the files and database.</p>

<h2>If SSH isn&rsquo;t enabled</h2>

<p>Sometimes the host disables SSH access, only allowing its use for SFTP. There are still many ways to acquire the site&rsquo;s files and database:</p>

<h3>Getting hold of the files</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Plain old FTP</strong> &ndash; You can just use an FTP client such as Filezilla to access and download the site&rsquo;s files using FTP or SFTP. This is the simplest way, but can take a long time because of the amount of files involved</li>
<li><strong>File Manager Web UI</strong> &ndash; compressing the site&rsquo;s files obviously shrinks the download size, but also vastly reduces the amount of connections you need to make, leading to a faster download speed.

<ol>
<li> Navigate to the File Manager section (remember to tick &ldquo;Show hidden files&rdquo; to pick up .htaccess files)</li>
<li>Browse to the web root folder, select all the files and folders you want using Ctrl+Click. Remember to exclude unnecessary large files such as sql dumps, media folders and the var folder</li>
<li>Click Compress from the toolbar</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Getting hold of the database</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>PHPMyAdmin</strong> &ndash; PHPMyAdmin offers an array of options for dumping your database. You should start by checking the database&rsquo;s size and considering excluding the dump of tables such as <code>log_url</code>, <code>log_url_info</code>, <code>log_visitor</code>, <code>log_visitor_info</code>, <code>report_viewed_product_index</code>

<ol>
<li> Navigate to the PHPMyAdmin area of cPanel and locate the database in use (check your <code>app/etc/local.xml</code> if you&rsquo;re not sure which</li>
<li>Click the Export tab</li>
<li>Select Custom: here&rsquo;s where you can selectively export information</li>
<li>Tick &lsquo;Disable foreign key checks&rsquo; and set &lsquo;Dump table&rsquo; to &lsquo;structure&rsquo;. This will have PHPMyAdmin set up only the tables' columns but no data (we&rsquo;ll get to that)</li>
<li>Click Go</li>
<li>Once this is complete, navigate back to the Export page and click Custom again.</li>
<li>Deselect (ctrl+click) any tables which are unnecessary</li>
<li>Tick &lsquo;Disable foreign key checks&rsquo; and set &lsquo;Dump table&rsquo; this time to &lsquo;data&rsquo;</li>
<li>This will provide you with two files representing the database. Import first the Structure one, and then the Data one (or concatenate the two together)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-1-8-released.html"/>
    <updated>2013-09-30T10:01:28+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-1-8-released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I got a notification through that Magento 1.8 had finally been released.</p>

<p>This has been in beta since alpha since April, and contains server fixes that a lot of people have been waiting for.</p>

<p>The most important one for UK vendors is that the rounding issue in tax calculations has been fixed.</p>

<p>There are also improvements to caching and database performance. The full release notes can be seen <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/knowledge-base/entry/ce-18-later-release-notes">here</a></p>

<p>These are issues that have affected merchants since that change in the VAT rate, so we would recommend upgrading for everyone at this time.</p>

    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/sylius-e-commerce-based-on-symfony</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As if there weren&rsquo;t enough!</p>

<p>There is a new contender for the open source e-commerce crown, a platform called <b><a href="http://sylius.com/features" target="_blank">Sylius</a></b>. The thing that makes this one especially interesting is that rather than being built from scratch it is based upon a very well established PHP framework called Symfony. Some would argue that Symfony is the &ldquo;other&rdquo; PHP framework alongside Zend Framework. In fact there are many frameworks however it would be fair to say that Symfony and Zend Framework are the most well established and up to date.</p>

<p>Basing an e-commerce platform upon an existing PHP framework has many advantages including transferrable skills, established best practice structure and also easier access to a wide range of functionality via library components and extensions.</p>

<p>There is another e-commerce platform based upon a PHP framework. It is based upon Zend Framework &ndash; you might have heard of it &ndash; Magento.</p>

<p>It does look very much like Sylius is still quite a new offering and it can not boast the level of maturity and establishment that Magento has achieved. That said, things move quickly in this industry and who knows what will be top dog in the next five years.</p>

<p>If you are considering Sylius for your e-commerce website and would like to find a UK Sylius developer to work with then do get in touch with Edmonds Commerce today.</p>

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/php/php-soap-client-basic-template.html"/>
    <updated>2013-07-08T08:28:17+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/php/php-soap-client-basic-template</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Often when integrating with SOAP services I find myself doing the same old moves. I have a deep suspicion of API&rsquo;s written by others. They always tend to be in ASP.net, have error message pages that have default messages and generally be really badly documented and coded. Maybe I&rsquo;m just unlucky?</p>

<p>In my experience decent API&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t use SOAP.</p>

<p>Anyway if I do have to use SOAP, starting out with this class as a template to get the ball rolling with some useful debugging methods (so you can email the API owners and show them that their API doesn&rsquo;t work), I&rsquo;ve blogged it for my own archive and retrieval reasons but if it helps anyone else out then that is great!</p>

<p>```php</p>

<p>&lt;?php
/<em>*

<p>class EdmondsCommerceSoap
{</p>

<pre><code>protected $username = 'edmondscommerce';

    $options["connection_timeout"] = 25;
    $options["location"] = $wsdl; 
    $options['trace'] = 1; //this is important if you want to be able to use the soapDebug method
    try {
        $client = new SoapClient($wsdl, $options);
        $client = $this-&gt;setAuthHeader($client);
        $client-&gt;Method();
    } catch (SoapFault $e) {

        echo '&lt;pre&gt;' . $e-&gt;getTraceAsString() . '&lt;/pre&gt;';
    }
    echo '&lt;h2&gt;Debug Info:&lt;/h2&gt;';
