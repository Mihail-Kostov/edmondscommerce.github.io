<p>Today I was working on an oscommerce site and took a backup of their database, created the usual details from their config file on my local mysql and the above error came up (with admin@localhost for what it&rsquo;s worth).</p>

<p>Upon investigation, a trigger had been created on the database whilst logged in via a different user than the user specified in the config file.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s actually a few solutions depending on your needs :&ndash;
Ensure the user (something@somewhere) is created on your new database installation
Delete the trigger (for instance if testing locally and you know it&rsquo;s not needed)
Edit the DB dump file, find the definition of the trigger and change it to the configured user.</p>
