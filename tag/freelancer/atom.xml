This is a post that was written a long time ago and is only being kept here for posterity.

<p>It seems that there are many UK webmasters who struggle to find a reliable UK based web developer who specialises in PHP. I have heard stories of people who claim to be osCommerce experts but in reality they simply know how to install a few contributions and that&rsquo;s about it.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a freelance osCommerce developer, especially if you would prefer to deal with someone else in the United Kingdom then you would do well to get in touch with me. I now have a long list of happy clients who have had their osCommerce sites improved, speeded up and automatically populated with huge catalogues.</p>

<p>So to clarify. Edmonds Commerce is a <b>Freelance web developer</b> who specialise in <b>osCommerce</b> and is <b>UK Based</b>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Edmonds Commerce also specialise in all <em>osCommerce Derived Systems</em> including <b>CRE Loaded</b>, <b>Zen Cart</b> etc.</p>
