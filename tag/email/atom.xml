    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>The problem with quoted replies</h2>

<p>One of Gmail&rsquo;s stronger features is its threaded email conversations, allowing you to see emails as a chain of the back-and-forth, instead of the classic Inbox and Sent folder situation.</p>

<p>Mail clients often include the email chain as part of the email itself, and for the most part these are marked up in such a way that Gmail can hide them with the small ellipses button.</p>

<p>Sometimes though this doesn&rsquo;t work, and you end up having to scroll past page after page of quoted replies, which can be a right pain.</p>

<p>In probably 75% of the cases these have some HTML wrapped around them, which we can use to hide them when needed.</p>

<h2>Using Stylish to hide them in your browser</h2>

<p>Because Gmail is a web-based client, you can use normal browser extensions to manipulate it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylish">Stylish</a> is a browser extension that allows you to set up CSS rules that are applied on the pages you&rsquo;re using.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a snippet of CSS that will hide the needless quoted replies, with the ability to hover over them if you really need to see them</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>// Make quoted replies a small block
.im, .gmail_extra {
  height:30px;
  width:100px;
  background:#EFEFEF;
  overflow:hidden;
  display:block;
}</p>

<p>// Allow these to be expanded when hovered
.im:hover,
.gmail_extra:hover
{
  height:auto;
  max-height:250px;
  width:auto;
  overflow:auto;
  background:#EFEFEF;
}</p>

<p>// Show a little notice that they can be expanded
.im:before, .gmail_extra:before {
  content:&ldquo;Snipped Quote, hover to expand&rdquo;;
  color:#666666;
}</p>

<p>// Don&rsquo;t hide nested quote blocks
.im .im,
.gmail_extra .gmail_extra,
.im .gmail_extra,
.gmail_extra .im</p>

<pre><code>  {
</code></pre>

<p>  height:auto;
  max-height:none;
  width:auto;
  overflow:auto;
  background:#EFEFEF;
}</p>

<p>.gmail_extra .im:before {
  content:&ldquo;&rdquo;;
}</p>

<p>```</p>

<h2>The result</h2>

<p>What was previously a big mess of nested quotes and signatures</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2015-03-02-GmailQuote1.png"></p>

<p>Becomes a small &ldquo;Hover to expand&rdquo; box</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2015-03-02-GmailQuote2.png"></p>

<p>Viewing it in the scrollable box</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2015-03-02-GmailQuote3.png"></p>

<p>These styles work at the date of publication, but obviously Google might change the classes used for these.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sending confidential information across the Internet is always risky as you never really know who or what may intentionally or accidentally look at a copy of your communication at some points.</p>

<p>Various tactics can be used to reduce the risk when sending confidential information. The current approach accepted by most people is the use of PGP or GPG. PGP and GPG are commercial and open source (respectively) implementations of asymmetric encryption system specifically designed to work with visible text communication.</p>

<p>Asymmetric cryptography works by using a key pair. When some thing is encrypted using one of the keys only the other key can be used to decrypt the encrypted text. This allows you to give away your public key to any one and every one and know that any thing some one encrypts with it cannot be retrieved any one other than your self. It is currently technically infeasible, and has stood up to 10 years of scrutiny so far, to determine one of the keys of a pair when having one of them.</p>

<p>The only real trouble after using this system is communicating the public key and knowing it has not been tampered with.</p>

<p>If you need to send Edmonds Commerce any confidential information securely feel free to encrypt it with our public key:

    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/php/migrate-to-google-apps-google-apps-reseller</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are big fans of Google Apps and have built a large portion of our business processes around the system. For this reason we have absolutely no problem recommending the service to our clients and have assisted numerous clients with a migration to the system.</p>

<p>The first benefit you will get is your emails migrated over and a much better email service. You have the option of using normal IMAP access so you can continue to use your preferred desktop application however we suspect that you will start to use the web interface as it is really quite powerful with some unique features that you can not access on a normal desktop client.</p>

<p>Along with this you have great support of mobile devices, especially if you opt for Android with powerful and free native apps meaning that you can have all the access to your emails that could possibly wish for.</p>

<p>Along with the really excellent email functionality you also have powerful online documents giving you the basic office application functionality along with really powerful collaboration features allowing multiple people to be working on the same document simultaneously from geographically separate locations. This can be great when putting together proposals, specifications etc.</p>

<p>Now called Google Drive, the documents system has grown from managing purely office documents into a fully featured online file store that can be used to store and share all kinds of files across your organisation and with third parties.</p>

<p>Finally the calendar functionality is great. If you have never used Google Calendar then I suspect the first things you will notice is the abilty to easily drag and drop appointments around when reorganising your schedule. The ability to quickly create appointments using natural language such as &ldquo;call steve at 11am&rdquo; is really nice. A full barrage of reminders can be set up if you wish including on screen, SMS and emails meaning you should never miss an appointment again.</p>

<p>All in all we think Google Apps is great and would love to help you move your organisation across to the system. If you would like to discuss this in more detail please do <a href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/contact-us"><b>get in touch today</b></a>.</p>

<p>Edmonds Commerce are a Google Apps Reseller.</p>

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/chrome-autocorrect-for-gmail-and-google-apps.html"/>
    <updated>2012-11-22T13:54:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/chrome-autocorrect-for-gmail-and-google-apps</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you use Gmail (also bundled with Google Apps) for your business then you probably write a lot of emails directly into the gmail interface. If you are like me you probably make teh the mistakes all teh time. (See what I did there!)</p>

<p>As the MD of Edmonds Commerce I probably write more emails than most people with everything from <a href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/platforms/magento">Magento</a> quotes, client communications, enquiries and maybe even the occasional personal email. At a guess I would say I write a good few thousand words per day. I should calculate that one day.</p>

<p>Well help is at hand with this wonderful chrome extension that will auto correct common typos as you type them in gmail. For me this is a real productivity booster as I type fast but badly and this really tidies up a lot of my common mistakes meaning less <em>backspace</em> and more <em>getting stuff done</em>.</p>

<p>You can grab the extension <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ezautocorrect-for-gmail/fholdolknchpdbajhpdenookmikblmda/related" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you find it useful. On another note, if you aren&rsquo;t currently using Google Apps (its free you know) and would like to look at transitioning your business to the system then get in touch with us and we would be happy to help you with it. I can not recommend the service enough to be honest, even if you go for the paid version the cost is negligible really. Smaller companies should be find with the free version though which you really can&rsquo;t argue with.</p>

    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/security/google-apps-and-two-factor-authentication</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are using Google apps and have two factor authentication turned on then you are probably using the convenient &ldquo;Remember this PC for 30 days&rdquo; feature.</p>

<p>If you like your browser to forget every thing except a very select set of data (bookmarks, etc.) but keep the convenience of the 30 day authentication then you only need to keep the cookie called &ldquo;SMSV&rdquo; for the domain &ldquo;www.google.com&rdquo; with path &ldquo;/a&rdquo;.</p>

<p>There is a variety of ways you can keep this cookie. You could, for example, export it then import it when ever (and where ever) you need it.</p>
