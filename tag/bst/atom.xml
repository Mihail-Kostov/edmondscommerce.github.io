<p>If you are finding that your calls to date() etc are displaying the wrong time then this is the solution for you.</p>

<p>Magento sets the internal time reference to UTC which does not account for daylight saving time adjustments.</p>

<p>To get the correct date for your store, you need to get the store time, so the correct method is like this:</p>

<p>```php</p>

<p>echo date(&lsquo;l, F j, Y, H:i:s&rsquo;, Mage::app()&ndash;>getLocale()&ndash;>storeTimeStamp());</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>If your Magento store is occasionally throwing up redirect loop errors in your web browser this might be your problem, and your solution.</p>

<p>It seems that Magento doesn&rsquo;t properly support British Summer Time as standard, so if you are using GMT then your times might be an hour out. That&rsquo;s not ideal but its not the end of the world. The problem arises in that the cookie lifespan is set to 1 hour by default. That means that as soon as a session cookie is set, it is expired and this can then send your browser into a redirect loop as cookies are set and expired successively.</p>

<p>The quick fix is simply to increase the cookie lifespan to something over 1 hour.</p>

<p>Another possible fix is detailed in this thread:
