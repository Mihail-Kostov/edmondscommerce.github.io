    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Magento has released the latest version of both CE and EE.</p>

<p>The big changes that are included are as follows</p>

<p><strong>Responsive design included as default</strong></p>

<p>Both editions now come with a responsive theme. This introduces jQuery, SASS, and Compass into native Magento and should allow for easier customisation in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Me Later</strong></p>

<p>The PayPal integration has been upgraded to include the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/promotional-financing">Bill Me Later</a> financing option. This allows customer to pay for products over six months whilst the merchant gets paid straight away.</p>

<p><strong>Other security fix and performance fixes</strong></p>

<p>The full list of changes can be seen <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/knowledge-base/entry/new-features-ce19-ee114">here</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are having issues with mod rewrite apparently abandoning sections of variables after encoded hashes then this could be your solution.</p>

<p>The use case is particularly clear when using mod_rewrite in front of a search engine (such as Solr which I am really enjoying working with at the moment).</p>

<p>Imagine someone search for a partcode ABC#123</p>

<p>This gets encoded to search/abc%23123</p>

<p>Your rewritten search term will then be mangled by Apache and your search script will only actually see ABC. That is of course a problem and the solution is not really clear.</p>

<p>After a bit of searching around I found the solution is to add a B flag to your mod_rewrite rule so that mod_rewrite will escape these characters so that they are cleanly passed through.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>```php</p>

<p>RewriteRule ^(.<em>)search/(.</em>)$ advanced_search_result.php?keywords=$2 [L,B]</p>

<p>```</p>

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-enterprise-1-8-features-solr.html"/>

    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-enterprise-1-8-features-solr</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Very interesting to read about the latest Magento Enterprise version release. Among other things, they have implemented <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a> for searching. Solr is what can only be called a &ldquo;proper search engine&rdquo; and is the alternative to searching a database which is the usual way the Magento search works.</p>

<p>By using a proper search engine, the site will be able to display better, more relevant results a lot faster than is possible with the database driven method. The main downside is that its complex to set up.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see if a paid or community extension becomes available to provide Solr to community edition users.</p>

<p>There is a Google Code project, but it seems to be dead in the water:</p>
