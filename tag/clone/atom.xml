<p>If you are using VirtualBox in Ubuntu for your virtual machine requirements, some times you might decide that you want to clone a machine so that you can have different versions of the OS (perhaps running different browser versions for example).</p>

<p>To clone the VDI you need to first of all completely shutdown the virtual machine.</p>

<p>Then you need to go to File->Virtual Media Manager and Release the VDI that you want to clone.</p>

<p>Next you need to open a terminal and type:</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>cd ~/.VirtualBox/HardDisks/</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>You need to figure out which VDI you want to clone (lets assume xp.vdi).</p>

<p>Next you need to run this command:</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>VBoxManage clonehd xp.vdi cloned_xp.vdi</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now back into the VirtualBox GUI, you need to go back to the Virtual Media Manager and click the Add icon and add your newly created cloned VDI.</p>

<p>Then you create a new VM as normal, but when you get to the Hard Disk part of the wizard, select the use existing hard disk option and select your new VDI.</p>

<p>If you are bewildered by the choice of lightbox style javascript plugins available, you might find this page useful:</p>

<p>Its a well organised matrix of lightbox clones so you can compare features and choose the right one for your specific requirements. Handy!</p>
