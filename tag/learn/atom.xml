<p>As previously announced, we have started to run a Magento training course. The course is targeted at Magento site owners who are new to the system and are keen to get the most out of their Magento store.</p>

<p>One of the key advantages of Magento is it&rsquo;s wealth of professional ecommerce features that all come bundled as standard. These really make it stand proud of the competition. However, if you don&rsquo;t know how to use those features then they are wasted. This course aims to rectify that.</p>
