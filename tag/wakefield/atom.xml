<p>Just an update for any PHP developers in and around the Leeds, Bradford and West Yorkshire region:</p>

<p>Edmonds Commerce are still looking for skilled and enthusiastic PHP developers to join the team.</p>

<p>Our focus is entirely on e-commerce which is an exciting and challenging field for the right kind of person.</p>

<p>We expect our developers to be at or around the Zend Certified Developer level but other than that there are no specific criteria.</p>

<p>If you are interested please do get in touch.</p>

<p>We will initially ask you to do a quick PHP quiz, if you want to do that straight away just go here</p>

<p><a href="http://www.edmonds-commerce.co.uk/PHPTest/form.php"><a href="http://www.edmonds-commerce.co.uk/PHPTest/form.php">http://www.edmonds-commerce.co.uk/PHPTest/form.php</a></a></p>

<p>Do <a href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/contact-us">get in touch directly</a> as well though, the spam bots quite enjoy filling it out as well and I haven&rsquo;t got around to protecting it.</p>
