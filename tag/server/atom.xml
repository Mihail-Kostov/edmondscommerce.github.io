    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over last few days we been doing a bit of work on doing some audits for people and one of the things that has come up is ssl. For the purpose of checking the servers ssl implementation we have been using <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">Qualys SSL Labs</a> which is a excelent tool.</p>

<p>The checker checks for the ssl certificate and tells you if your server setup is vulnerable to attacks such as Poodle and OpenSSL CCS Injection. We will produce a blog post shortly on the best practise setup to prevent these attcks.</p>

<p>For the moment SHA-1 as a certificate signature algorithm is getting depricated in <a href="https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2014/09/09/sha1-deprecation-what-you-need-to-know">chrome</a>. As the cost for collision attcks against SHA-1 will become more <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/10/when_will_we_se.html">affordable</a> in the next few years.</p>

<p>Goole have set the cut off for certificates after 2016 but we will be seeing some crosses on the padlock in chrom during the first quater of 2015.</p>

<p>If your certificate expires in 2015 then you will not see any chrome. If your certificate expires in 2016 you will see some minor errors being reported in chrome. However if your certificate expires in 2017 then chrome will treat it as an insecure certificate in 2015.</p>

<p>So our advice is:</p>

<ul>
<li>If your certificate expires in 2015: When you come to renew make sure you get SHA-256 as the certificate signature</li>
<li>If your certificate expires in 2016: Think about getting renewed during 2015 or earlier.</li>
<li>If your certificate expires in 2017: Think about getting a new one issue as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>

    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/load%20testing/using-apache-jmeter-for-load-testing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Load testing is something that you really need a decent solution for. A simple tool such as Apache Bench (ab) is overly simplistic for todays web applications.</p>

<p>After some research I decided to use Apache Jmeter as the tool of choice. It is written in Java so easy enough to run on any platform.
It features a GUI which is ideal for creating your tests, then a command line version which is what you should use to run your tests.</p>

<p>For my purposes I wanted to feed in a large list of URLs, for that I followed these instructions:
<a href="http://asciiville.com/musings/coder/how-to-feed-jmeter-from-csv">http://asciiville.com/musings/coder/how-to-feed-jmeter-from-csv</a></p>

<p>This allows you to create a csv file with your choice of URLs. It was actually quite hard to find a decent and succint guide to getting this set up but thankfully that page fitted my requirements.</p>

<p>Once I started to run the test I quickly realised that my system was grinding to a halt with out of memory errors. A bit more searching yielded this page which advises on how to properly run Jmeter including the fact that you really should run it on the command line for proper testing.

    <updated>2013-05-09T12:15:23+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/testing-a-magento-site-in-maintenance-mode</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Often you&rsquo;ll have your site in maintenance mode, but obviously before you show your changes to the world you&rsquo;ll want to check the site over.</p>

<p>The best way to set Magento into Maintenance Mode is to add a maintenance.flag file to the web root, and there&rsquo;s a snippet of code in Magento&rsquo;s index.php which handles this:</p>

<p>```php</p>

<p>$maintenanceFile = &lsquo;maintenance.flag&rsquo;;</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>if (file_exists($maintenanceFile)) {</p>

<pre><code>include_once dirname(__FILE__) . '/errors/503.php';
exit;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll want to set this to also take your IP address into consideration, so just make the following amends and you&rsquo;ll have added conditional maintenance mode:</p>

<p>```php</p>

<p>$maintenanceFile = &lsquo;maintenance.flag&rsquo;;</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>if (file_exists($maintenanceFile) &amp;&amp; $_SERVER[&lsquo;REMOTE_ADDR&rsquo;] != &quot;123.123.123.123&quot;) {</p>

<pre><code>if($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] == &amp;quot;123.123.123.123&amp;quot;) {
    //Do nothing, but it's safer to check if it *is* your IP than *isn't*
}
else {
    include_once dirname(__FILE__) . '/errors/503.php';
    exit;
</code></pre>

<p>   }
}</p>

<p>```</p>

    <updated>2013-04-25T10:14:30+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/prestashop/prestashop-debug-mode-using-the-magento-environment-variable-method</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Magento developers are no doubt familiar with the concept of defining a server environment variable MAGE_IS_DEVELOPER_MODE so that when running Magento locally it is always in developer mode but there is no chance of accidently deploying a live site in developer mode.</p>

<p>This little trick will allow you to use the same environment variable to also have the same effect when working with PrestaShop.</p>

<p>To explain &ndash; developer mode generally means that things like error messages and debugging information are displayed clearly in the browser which makes things much easier when you are developing, to see what is going wrong.</p>

<p>On a live site you want to keep error information hidden and generally display to the customer a more friendly error message screen that perhaps helps them find their way back to a functional section of the site or gives them information to contact the site owner directly for assistance.</p>

<p>Anyway, to put PrestaShop in debug mode locally but have no risk of deployign this to live you can alter the file: config/defines.inc.php</p>

<p>from
```php</p>

<p>define(&lsquo;<em>PS_MODE_DEV</em>&rsquo;, false);</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>to
```php</p>

<p>define(&lsquo;<em>PS_MODE_DEV</em>&rsquo;, isset($_SERVER[&lsquo;MAGE_IS_DEVELOPER_MODE&rsquo;]));</p>

<p>```</p>

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/sagepay/release-sagepay-form-orders-via-api.html"/>
    <updated>2013-03-19T17:54:16+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/sagepay/release-sagepay-form-orders-via-api</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you use SagePay Form integration then you might think that it is impossible to release orders created via this integration system via the API.</p>

<p>Historically this was true however thanks to the new admin and reporting API you can now grab all of the details you need to perform the kind of admin side integration previously only possible via Server and Direct integrations.</p>

<p>This does take a bit of work but if you like the fact that Form alleviates PCI compliance issues, allows your customers to use the nice easy to use Form interface and also gives you easy PayPal integration then this is a great solution.</p>

<p>Thanks goes out to SagePay&rsquo;s technical support who have proved really helpful in ironing out the kinks in getting this working.</p>
