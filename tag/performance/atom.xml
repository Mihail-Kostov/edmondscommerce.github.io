    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here is a little bash script we knocked together to track down some malicious activity on a clients server.</p>

<p>Using a bit of awk etc to parse the log files we could quickly track down an IP address that was overloading the server and then take steps to block that person.</p>

<p>Here is the script:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>!/bin/bash</h1>

<h6>SETUP</h6>

<p>LOG_FOLDER=/var/www/vhosts/domain.co.uk/statistics/logs
ACCESS_LOG=$LOG_FOLDER/access_log</p>

<p>HOW_MANY_ROWS=20000</p>

<h6>### FUNCTIONS</h6>

<p>function title() {</p>

<pre><code>echo "
</code></pre>

<hr />

<h2>$@</h2>

<p>&ldquo;
}</p>

<p>function urls_by_ip() {</p>

<pre><code>local IP=$1
tail -5000 $ACCESS_LOG | awk -v ip=$IP ' $1 ~ ip {freq[$7]++} END {for (x in freq) {print freq[x], x}}' | sort -rn | head -20
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>function ip_addresses_by_user_agent(){</p>

<pre><code>local USERAGENT_STRING="$1"
local TOP_20_IPS="`tail  -$HOW_MANY_ROWS $ACCESS_LOG | grep "${USERAGENT_STRING}"  | awk '{freq[$1]++} END {for (x in freq) {print freq[x], x}}' | sort -rn | head -20`"
echo "$TOP_20_IPS"
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<h6># RUN REPORTS</h6>

<p>title &ldquo;top 20 URLs&rdquo;
TOP_20_URLS=&ldquo;<code>tail -$HOW_MANY_ROWS $ACCESS_LOG | awk '{freq[$7]++} END {for (x in freq) {print freq[x], x}}' | sort -rn | head -20</code>&rdquo;
echo &ldquo;$TOP_20_URLS&rdquo;</p>

<p>title &ldquo;top 20 URLS excluding POST data&rdquo;
TOP_20_URLS_WITHOUT_POST=&ldquo;<code>tail  -$HOW_MANY_ROWS $ACCESS_LOG | awk -F"[ ?]" '{freq[$7]++} END {for (x in freq) {print freq[x], x}}' | sort -rn | head -20</code>&rdquo;
echo &ldquo;$TOP_20_URLS_WITHOUT_POST&rdquo;</p>

<p>title &ldquo;top 20 IPs&rdquo;
TOP_20_IPS=&ldquo;<code>tail  -$HOW_MANY_ROWS $ACCESS_LOG | awk '{freq[$1]++} END {for (x in freq) {print freq[x], x}}' | sort -rn | head -20</code>&rdquo;
echo &ldquo;$TOP_20_IPS&rdquo;</p>

<p>title &ldquo;top 20 user agents&rdquo;
TOP_20_USER_AGENTS=&ldquo;<code>tail  -$HOW_MANY_ROWS $ACCESS_LOG | cut -d\  -f12- | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20</code>&rdquo;
echo &ldquo;$TOP_20_USER_AGENTS&rdquo;</p>

<p>title &ldquo;IP Addresses for Top 3 User Agents&rdquo;</p>

<p>for ((I=1; I&lt;=3; I++))
do</p>

<pre><code>UA="`echo "$TOP_20_USER_AGENTS" | head -n $I | tail -n 1 | awk '{$1=""; print $0}'`"
echo "$UA"
echo "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-block-caching-cache-key-helper-method-generate-safe-unique-cache-keys.html"/>
    <updated>2012-12-04T12:21:44+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-block-caching-cache-key-helper-method-generate-safe-unique-cache-keys</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you do any work at all on Magento performance optimisation with a view to making pages load faster then you must have come across block caching. To understand block caching you need to first of all understand that a Magento page is actually made up of a lot of nested chunks called blocks.</p>

<p>Blocks can have their HTML generated dynamically every time though it is also possible to make Magento cache the block HTML output so that it loads a LOT faster, especially with heavy and slow blocks such as best sellers etc.</p>

<p>When setting up block caching, you need to specify a cache key. If your cache key is not unique enough then there is a risk that you will display the wrong cache for a particular scenario.</p>

<p>For this reason I created a block caching helper with this method that can generate a very unique cache key based on the current block usage.
/app/code/local/EdmondsCommerce/Helper/Data.php
```php</p>

<p>/**</p>

<pre><code> * Generate a nice unique block cache key
 *
 * @param Mage_Core_Block_Abstract $block
 * @return string
 */
public function ecCacheKey(Mage_Core_Block_Abstract $block){
    $class = get_class($block);
    $template = $block-&gt;getTemplateFile();
    $md5 = md5(var_export($block-&gt;getData(), true));
    $params = trim(implode(",", $block-&gt;getRequest()-&gt;getParams()), ',');
    $category=($block-&gt;getCurrentCategory())?$block-&gt;getCurrentCategory()-&gt;getName():'no-category';
    $store_id = Mage::app()-&gt;getStore()-&gt;getId();
    return 'edmondscommerce-'. $params . '-'. $category . '-' . $store_id . '-' . $class.'-'.$template.'-'.$md5;
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>You would use this in the following way:</p>

<p>In a block class, set up the following:
```php</p>

<pre><code>public function _construct(){
    parent::_construct();
    $this-&gt;addData(array(
        'cache_lifetime' =&gt; 999999999,
        'cache_tags' =&gt; array(Mage_Catalog_Model_Product::CACHE_TAG, Mage_Catalog_Model_Category::CACHE_TAG),
        'cache_key' =&gt; Mage::helper('blockcaching')-&gt;ecCacheKey($this)
    ));

}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/prestashop/extending-a-modules-css-within-a-theme-in-prestashop.html"/>
    <updated>2012-11-28T17:26:39+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/prestashop/extending-a-modules-css-within-a-theme-in-prestashop</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>PrestaShop has a really nice structure for handling all the CSS that will appear in a site. It starts by splitting the CSS so that the CSS is split up per modules. There is a global CSS sheet but this should only be used for things that genuinely appear on all pages.</p>

<p>Extending the CSS of a module in PrestaShop is easy. All you need to do is create a CSS file that matches the naming convention of the module you are looking to extend.</p>

<p>For example if you wanted to change the CSS of the “Wishlist block” module (a.k.a. blockwishlist) in your theme, you would create the file themes/mytheme/css/modules/blockwishlist/blockwishlist.css. This file will then be included on every page that the CSS from the blockwishlist module appears on.</p>

<p>This system is good because it minimises the amount of CSS the browser has to load and also splits the concern of CSS into separate files making it much easier to manage. It also makes adding to a modules CSS with in a theme much easier.</p>

<p>One problem with this method of handling CSS is that by default a PrestaShop site may want the browser to download ten or more individual CSS files which is quite a overhead. Fortunately since PrestaShop 1.4 it has supported CCS merging (referred to as CCC in the admin) which causes the CSS for a page to be merged into a single file on the server to prevent the client having to download tens of CSS files.</p>

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/oscommerce/oscommerce-php-5-2-upgrade-you-really-should-get-onto-php-5-3-asap.html"/>
    <updated>2012-11-26T17:36:22+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/oscommerce/oscommerce-php-5-2-upgrade-you-really-should-get-onto-php-5-3-asap</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many of our clients use <a href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/platforms/oscommerce">osCommerce</a> for their online store. osCommerce was very popular a few years ago and to date still powers a really large number of stores. Due to a variety of technical reasons, many osCommerce stores are still hosting on PHP version 5.2.</p>

<p>The latest version of PHP is 5.4 and 5.5 is due out fairly soon. Most hosting companies will now regard PHP 5.3 to be the minimum version they will support. By switching to PHP 5.3 they get better performance and better security. Unfortunately if you are running an osCommerce store and your hosting company decides to upgrade PHP then you might find that your entire store stops working.</p>

<p>The first instinct here is to get your store back online as quickly as possible and that is entirely understandable. These days though we really think that osCommerce store owners should be running on PHP 5.3. It is entirely possible to do this and does not necessarily entail a large amount of work depending on which contributions you are running.</p>

<p>The last release for PHP 5.2 was <a href="http://www.php.net/archive/2010.php#id2010-12-16-1" target="_blank">version 5.2.16 released back in 2010</a>. In software terms that is really quite a long time ago and really underlines how much of an issue this is.</p>

<p>You can read about some of the performance gains of switching to PHP 5.3 or greater on <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/features.gc.performance-considerations.php" target="_blank">this page</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like some help getting your osCommerce store working on an up to date version of PHP then <b><a href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/contact-us">get in touch with Edmonds Commerce today</a></b>.</p>

<p>Of course another option is to think about moving away from osCommerce and onto a more up to date platform such as <a href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/platforms/oscommerce">osCommerce</a> or <a href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/platforms/opencart">OpenCart</a>. If you are thinking of ugprading then 5.3 compatability will be a bonus. If you are not thinking of upgrading platform any time soon though you really do need to schedule in an upgrade to PHP 5.3 at the earliest opportunity.</p>

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-profiler-improved-aoe_profiler-by-fabrizio-branca.html"/>

    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-profiler-improved-aoe_profiler-by-fabrizio-branca</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Magento profiler is useful when you are trying to discover what potential bottlenecks are in place in a specific Magento implementation that are slowing down the performance of the site. Often when doing this kind of analysis you might find that a particular block or extension is responsible for more than 70% of the total page load time. At this point you would choose to either optimise, cache or disable the block altogether to remove this performance bottleneck and improve page speed significantly.</p>

<p>If you have ever tried to use Magento&rsquo;s built in profiler you will no doubt agree with Fabrizio&rsquo;s comments that, when you have it working, the output is hard to read and not really very useful in terms of seeing what is actually going on.</p>

<p>To aid with this process and give us a nice colourful and friendly user interface to the Magento profiler, Fabrizio has built a Magento module that extends the default profiler and makes it a much more useful tool.</p>

<p>You can download the extension from <a href="https://github.com/fbrnc/Aoe_Profiler" title="Magento Aoe Profiler on Git Hub" target="_blank">git hub here</a>.</p>

<p>Read the full blog story <a href="http://www.fabrizio-branca.de/magento-profiler.html" title="Fabrizio Branch blog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
