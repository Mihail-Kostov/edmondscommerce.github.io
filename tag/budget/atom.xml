<p>If you are putting together a new web site and would like a logo and design creating, the traditional approach is to first choose a design agency and then get them to create a design for you.</p>

<p>However a new approach is to get the agencies to create the designs first and you choose your favourite.</p>

<p>For logo designs, check out <a href="http://logotournament.com/" rel="nofollow">Logo Tournament</a></p>

<p>For full site designs, check out <a href="http://99designs.com" rel="nofollow">99 Designs</a></p>

<p>Both sites offer a similar idea.</p>

<p>The quality of the designs is often really quite good, though I think you have to accept that a lot of agencies will not be able to compete in this kind of market place so you are only really catering to designers who are freelancers and are able to do work with potentially no return.</p>

<p>I have seen mixed results with these kinds of sites, but they are definitely worth looking into especially if budgets are tight and you are prepared to take a bit of a risk.</p>
