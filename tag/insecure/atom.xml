    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Often you will see SSL warnings or errors related to insecure content being displayed on a secure page.</p>

<p>This could be as simple as one javascript file or image that is being included via http rather than https, though some times this can be a bit tricky to track down.</p>

<p>The easiest solution is to hit this site:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whynopadlock.com/"><a href="http://www.whynopadlock.com/">http://www.whynopadlock.com/</a></a></p>

<p>This will give you a clear report of the problems and should help you quickly find and fix them.</p>

<p>Alternatively if you use Chrome you may see the details in the Javascript console.</p>

<p>Once you know what elements are being called by http as opposed to https, you simply need to make them use https or remove them altogether.</p>
