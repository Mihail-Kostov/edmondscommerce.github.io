    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Quite often you drop a load of files in to a git repo, such as a Magento extension, and then immediately regret it. But now you have a pile of files scattered across the repo and no way to Ctrl+Z out of the situation.</p>

<p>This leaves us with some options:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>git reset --hard HEAD</code>, but that&rsquo;ll only revert any changes to <em>tracked</em> files. What about the untracked files in <code>git status</code>?</li>
<li>Manually <code>rm -rf file1 file2 folder1 folder2</code> but that&rsquo;s a lot of copypasting.</li>
<li><code>git clean -f</code>, but that <em>will remove all untracked files, including your gitignored ones</em>, so we don&rsquo;t want that.</li>
</ul>


<p>The best way is to <strong>automate the <code>rm -rf</code> procedure</strong> mentioned above using the following command</p>

<pre><code>git status --porcelain | sed 's#^...##' | while read f; do rm -rf $f; done
</code></pre>

<p>The TL;DR of this command is that it outputs <code>git status</code> in a parseable way, and then loops over each file/folder and deletes it. You can see a <a href="http://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=git+status+--porcelain+%7C+sed+%27s%23%5E...%23%23%27+%7C+while+read+f%3B+do+rm+-rf+%24f%3B+done">full command breakdown here</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you do a Git Merge using Meld (a brilliant Linux diff tool) then you might find that there are a bunch of files created that you need to clear up.</p>

<p>These files will be copies of the merged files and can be safely removed as everything you should need to know is already in Git.</p>

<p>I wrote the following quick function to find all of these files and remove them. You could add this as a function to your bashrc file if you need to do this regularly.</p>

<p>Here is the BASH snippet:</p>

<p><code>bash
git status -su | grep -P "\.BACKUP|BASE|LOCAL|REMOTE\." | cut -f2 -d" " | xargs rm
</code></p>

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/composer/merging-forks-for-composer.html"/>
    <updated>2013-12-05T19:53:16+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/composer/merging-forks-for-composer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am really enjoying using Composer with a Symfony2 project that I am currently working on.</p>

<p>Recently though I found an issue where I am using the FOSRest Bundle to provide JSON API functionality. This in turn uses the
JMS/SerializerBundle to handle the actual encoding into JSON.</p>

<p>The problem is that the JMS bundle converts camelCase to snake_case and I decided I really didn&rsquo;t want that. I want my property and entity names to be the same across formats.</p>

<p>A bit of digging and I found <a href="https://github.com/passkey1510/JMSSerializerBundle">this fork</a> which features a fix for exactly this problem, brilliant!</p>

<p>However on trying to get this to install with Composer I simply could not get it to work. Further investigation shows that the version of the JMS bundle that this fork does not meet
the minimum version requirements of the FOSRest bundle. Problem.</p>

<p>The solution in the end was to fork the JMSSerializerBundle Directly then pull this down locally. Once I had that locally I then added the fork with the fix I need as another remote:</p>

<p><code>
git remote add passkey1510 git@github.com:passkey1510/JMSSerializerBundle.git
git merge remote/passkey1510/master
git push
</code></p>

<p>Those three commands added the other fork as another remote allowing me to pull in the commits that feature the fix I need. Finally I pushed this back up to github.</p>

<p>I can now reference my fork in my composer.json file like this:</p>

<p>```
&ldquo;repositories&rdquo;: [</p>

<pre><code>    {
        "url": "https://github.com/edmondscommerce/JMSSerializerBundle.git",
        "type": "vcs"
    },
</code></pre>

<p>],
```</p>

<p>Now running a <code>composer update --dev</code> and composer successfully brought in my fork of the Serializerbundle with the extra fixes to allow the property names to stay in camelCase.</p>

<p>And that is it, problem solved :)</p>

    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/git/a-great-way-to-simplify-git-merges</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are struggling with a git merge with a long list of failed merge files then this little trick might be helpful.</p>

<p>The standard approach is to go file by file and use git mergetool to open the files in a tool like Meld and then manually manage the differences. In many cases though you know exactly which version you want and this is simply a laborious process that doesn&rsquo;t really require human input.</p>

<p>The solution to this is deceptively simple. All you need to do is to check out the file from the branch you want to keep the version of. If you have an entire directory where you know that the branch (for example master) has the correct version then you can check out that entire directory.</p>

<p>You might find that sensible use of this technique can save you lots of time and really make the mergetool the one you use for the files where you really do need to merge.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/914939/simple-tool-to-accept-theirs-or-accept-mine-on-a-whole-file-using-git?answertab=active#tab-top">this StackOverflow answer</a> for simplifying this for me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you receive this series of errors during a git pull (after the Receiving Objects stage):</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>$ git pull
Password for &lsquo;<a href="https://xxxxxxxxxx@bitbucket.org">https://xxxxxxxxxx@bitbucket.org</a>&rsquo;:
remote: Counting objects: 1011, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (394/394), done.
error: RPC failed; result=56, HTTP code = 200 51 KiB/s    <br/>
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
fatal: early EOF
fatal: index-pack failed</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>a quick solution is to use ssh to pull rather than the https protocol</p>

<p>Hope this helps</p>
