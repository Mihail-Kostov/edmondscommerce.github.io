    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am really enjoying using Composer with a Symfony2 project that I am currently working on.</p>

<p>Recently though I found an issue where I am using the FOSRest Bundle to provide JSON API functionality. This in turn uses the
JMS/SerializerBundle to handle the actual encoding into JSON.</p>

<p>The problem is that the JMS bundle converts camelCase to snake_case and I decided I really didn&rsquo;t want that. I want my property and entity names to be the same across formats.</p>

<p>A bit of digging and I found <a href="https://github.com/passkey1510/JMSSerializerBundle">this fork</a> which features a fix for exactly this problem, brilliant!</p>

<p>However on trying to get this to install with Composer I simply could not get it to work. Further investigation shows that the version of the JMS bundle that this fork does not meet
the minimum version requirements of the FOSRest bundle. Problem.</p>

<p>The solution in the end was to fork the JMSSerializerBundle Directly then pull this down locally. Once I had that locally I then added the fork with the fix I need as another remote:</p>

<p><code>
git remote add passkey1510 git@github.com:passkey1510/JMSSerializerBundle.git
git merge remote/passkey1510/master
git push
</code></p>

<p>Those three commands added the other fork as another remote allowing me to pull in the commits that feature the fix I need. Finally I pushed this back up to github.</p>

<p>I can now reference my fork in my composer.json file like this:</p>

<p>```
&ldquo;repositories&rdquo;: [</p>

<pre><code>    {
        "url": "https://github.com/edmondscommerce/JMSSerializerBundle.git",
        "type": "vcs"
    },
</code></pre>

<p>],
```</p>

<p>Now running a <code>composer update --dev</code> and composer successfully brought in my fork of the Serializerbundle with the extra fixes to allow the property names to stay in camelCase.</p>

<p>And that is it, problem solved :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are struggling with a git merge with a long list of failed merge files then this little trick might be helpful.</p>

<p>The standard approach is to go file by file and use git mergetool to open the files in a tool like Meld and then manually manage the differences. In many cases though you know exactly which version you want and this is simply a laborious process that doesn&rsquo;t really require human input.</p>

<p>The solution to this is deceptively simple. All you need to do is to check out the file from the branch you want to keep the version of. If you have an entire directory where you know that the branch (for example master) has the correct version then you can check out that entire directory.</p>

<p>You might find that sensible use of this technique can save you lots of time and really make the mergetool the one you use for the files where you really do need to merge.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/914939/simple-tool-to-accept-theirs-or-accept-mine-on-a-whole-file-using-git?answertab=active#tab-top">this StackOverflow answer</a> for simplifying this for me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you receive this series of errors during a git pull (after the Receiving Objects stage):</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>$ git pull
Password for &lsquo;<a href="https://xxxxxxxxxx@bitbucket.org">https://xxxxxxxxxx@bitbucket.org</a>&rsquo;:
remote: Counting objects: 1011, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (394/394), done.
error: RPC failed; result=56, HTTP code = 200 51 KiB/s    <br/>
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
fatal: early EOF
fatal: index-pack failed</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>a quick solution is to use ssh to pull rather than the https protocol</p>

<p>Hope this helps</p>

    <li>Right-click your public key file and open in a text editor</li>
    <li>Remove the lines beginning with -- and the Comment line</li>
    <li>Remove any remaining line breaks</li>
    <li>Prepend the key with "ssh-rsa " - including the space</li>
    <li>Paste this into the Key field</li>
</ul>




<h2>Clone the repository</h2>


<ul>
    <li>Right-click a folder in Explorer > Git Clone</li>
    <li>Copy the repository access from the Repository's main page, on the right next to the SSH button</li>

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/git/managing-your-web-site-and-code-version-control.html"/>
    <updated>2013-03-11T18:22:29+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/git/managing-your-web-site-and-code-version-control</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Managing a web site posses many difficulties. On the technical side of things there are really two big problems which are the database and the code for the site.</p>

<p>Managing the database is currently the hardest thing to do right. The best you can do generally is to make sure you have a daily backup. Then if some thing should happen you would only lose up to 24 hours of new products, order and customers. Significantly more complex solutions are available that offer grater flexibility but these solutions usually depend on the hosting company to support it and often have a large setup cost.</p>

<p>Conversely, on the code management there are many solutions available that can be implemented easily and generally do not require the assistance of the hosting provider.
To get your sites code base under control you need to use a version control system. A version control system is a system that remembers every change made to code at a given point in time and allows you to easily see the differences between different versions.</p>

<p>Been able to see the many different versions of all the files that make up the site gives you the following advantages:
You can see when some thing changed.
You can see what was changed.
You can see who changed it.
You can see why it was changed.
You can see the logical progress of changes that lead to a given state.</p>

<p>Version control is important to maintaining a good code base for all the reasons above plus more (integration with issue tracking, deployment and other systems). It can also be invaluable in disaster recovery scenarios where some code has been altered and it&rsquo;s negatively impacted the site even out side of the version control system. In such scenarios you can take what ever is on the live site and compare it with what is in the version control system really easily.</p>

<p>It used to be the case that using version control was quite a difficult and technical matter. Fortunately since then there are many tools and websites available to make the whole process much easier.</p>

<p>GitHub and Bitbucket are currently two really popular websites for hosting Git repositories and provide much material for helping new users along.</p>

<p>At Edmonds Commerce Git is our version control system of choice because it&rsquo;s very powerful, highly flexible and integrates with many systems. There are several different clients available to help you along with Git but due to the flexibility that git offers to do certain things you may end up reverting to the command line.</p>

<p>Here is a list of alternative to the TortoiseGit (a popular Windows tool) client
