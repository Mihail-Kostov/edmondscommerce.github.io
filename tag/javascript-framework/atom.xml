<p>I read on <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/ouh-shiny-bbcs-glow-is-finally-out" rel="nofollow">Ajaxian</a> today that the BBC have released their own javascript library, Glow,  as open source. This is a nice move on the part of the BBC and great news for anyone looking to develop a site with some nice AJAX features but with a priority on accessibility and broad browser support.</p>

<p>The core reason that the BBC use their own library instead of one of the existing javascript libraries is one of browser support. As stated on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/glow/docs/articles/what_is_glow.shtml" rel="nofollow">Glow site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>However, on reviewing the major libraries we found that none met our standards and guidelines, with browser support in particular being a major issue.</blockquote>
