<p>Edmonds Commerce are big believers in open source software and especially open source ecommerce packages which are our speciality.</p>

<p>There is an excellent selection of open source ecommerce platforms available today including Magento and Open Cart, old favourites like osCommerce (Zen Cart, CRE Loaded) and Presta Shop.</p>

<p>One that you might not have heard of though that is definitely worth a look is <a href="http://www.tomatocart.com" target="_blank">TomatoCart</a>. The key wow factor in this cart is the RIA style admin that basically looks and feels like a windows desktop. This makes it very intuitive and powerful to use and definitely feels like the way the web based apps of the future will work. Check out the <a href="http://www.tomatocart.com/products/store-demo.html" target="_blank">demo</a></p>

<p>TomatoCart is a direct descendant of oscommerce and is based on the oscommerce 3 codebase (which never made it beyond alpha status). It comes feature packed as standard with a slick and intuitive front end with features like image zoom, home page slide show and product comparison. You can read the full list of features <a href="http://www.tomatocart.com/products/features.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
