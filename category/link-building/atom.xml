<p>Edmonds Commerce is very pleased to announce the launch of our new <b>link building service</b>.</p>

<p>Any site that wishes to rank well in the search engines for competitive keywords needs to have a link building campaign as an important part of it&rsquo;s SEO strategy. If you are looking to outsource your link building, it is important that you use a company with a deep understanding of SEO. We can offer this to you.</p>

<p>You need to take care choosing your link building service as there are numerous potential pitfalls and mistakes that can be made with a link building campaign and it is all too easy to waste your money on worthless or even counter productive link building strategies.</p>

<p>It is for this reason we have decided to launch our <b>link building service</b>, offering you peace of mind based on the trust that we have built up as a web development company and with the quality and reliability that our development customers already enjoy.</p>

<p>If you are interested in outsourcing your link building to Edmonds Commerce, simply <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/contact-about-link-building-service.html"><b>drop us an email</b></a> or alternatively give us a call on <b>0844 357 0201</b></p>

<p><b>What&rsquo;s Involved?</b></p>

<p>We will ask you for a monthly budget and will work with you to choose some keywords to target. We will then use this budget to build the maximum quantity and quality links possible for you, to the high standards we demand.</p>

<p>What we ask from you as the client is simply a monthly commitment of a set budget to build these links. We strongly believe that a link building campaign should be consistent and permanent rather than a short sharp spike every now and then. For brand new sites there is an argument that an initial burst of link building can be beneficial, primarily to help get the site spidered, but in the longer term a steady stream of new inbound links is much better.</p>

<p>As an initial budget we ask for a minimum of <strong>£100 per month</strong>. Of course you can spend as much as you want, but its more important that is is sustainable so choose a price that is affordable. If that is a bit too much for you, we suggest you look into link building for yourself. Note we really emphasise that you must be able to sustain this price on a monthly basis for at least 6 months. We do not believe or advise in flash in the pan SEO campaigns and strongly suggest implementing a consistent and long term SEO strategy.</p>

<p><b>How Quickly Will it Benefit the Site?</b>
SEO is a long term strategy with a delayed gratification. There are short cuts and possibilities to shoot to the top, but these techniques (often referred to as &lsquo;black hat&rsquo;) are not recommended if you are looking for something reliable and long term. How quickly the new links will start to benefit your site is hard to judge with precision and of course it depends on other factors such as the SEO of the actual site pages themselves and how competitive your particular keywords are. As a general idea though, we would expect to see benefits within a couple of months or so. That said, we are seeing nearly instant benefit to some of our clients who have established sites. It seems they just needed that little extra push for the search engines to really dig into them.</p>

<p><b>Are there Other Thing&rsquo;s My Site Needs for SEO?</b>
Yes link building is only one aspect of a successful SEO campaign. More important than link building is ensuring that the site itself is optimised. This is already something that Edmonds Commerce offers as a service. This is kind of SEO comes under the umbrella term of &lsquo;on site&rsquo; or &lsquo;on page&rsquo; SEO.</p>

<p>Another important factor in SEO is having quality original and keyword rich textual content on your site. Writing search engine friendly text does not require any particular specialist or technical knowledge other than a broad understanding of the principles of SEO and of course a flair for writing helps! We will gladly advise you on how to go about writing optimised content and can give you some pointers on how to improve your content.</p>

<p>If you would be interested in outsourcing your search engine optimised textual content creation do get in touch as we are considering adding this to our portfolio of services at some point in the future.</p>

<p><b>What is Page Rank?</b>
Often you will hear the term page rank (often abbreviated to PR). This refers to Google&rsquo;s Page Rank system. This system gives each page on the internet that Google is aware of a score from 0 to 10. The best score is 10 and 0 is of course the lowest. There are some pages that Google is not even aware of.</p>

<p>Very roughly speaking, Google scores these pages in terms of how many links from other sites are linking to the specific page. If there are lots of other pages linking to this page, the page rank for this page will be higher. Also, PR is passed on. So if your page has lots of links from pages that have a high PR then its likely that your page will have a high PR. Conversely if all of the pages linking to your page have a PR of 0, or worse aren&rsquo;t even known by Google at all, then your PR is likely to be low.</p>

<p><b>Why does PR Matter?</b>
Generally speaking, if there are two pages about the same subject and they are both equal in terms of their &lsquo;on site&rsquo; SEO then the page with the higher page rank will rank higher in the search results than the page with lower page rank. That&rsquo;s it basically, its a factor in determining which pages should be displayed higher in the results. It is by no means the only factor but it is definitely involved.</p>

<p>One of the most important aspects of a successful SEO campaign is the building of links from external web sites that point to your web site. However it is not as simple as that. There are good links and bad links. If it was as simple as building the most amount of links possible then it would be very easy for those of us with a little bit of know how to completely dominate the search engine results pages.</p>

<p>No these days you need to build quality inbound links that are from reputable web pages. The links must not have the rel=&ldquo;nofollow&rdquo; attribute as if they do they will effectively be worthless to you in terms of SEO. The no follow attribute was brought in to try and combat the explosion of blog comment spam. The idea being that if blogs are set up to automatically nofollow all links posted in comments then the spammer might give up.</p>

<p><strong>What Makes a Good Link? </strong></p>

<p>A good link will firstly be from a page that is relevant to the page that you are trying to promote. So lets say for example you are trying to build links to your category page where you display your range of rabbit hutches and other rabbit related paraphenalia, then ideally you want to be building links on other web pages that are also rabbit related.</p>

<p>You might decide to take Google&rsquo;s toolbar pagerank into consideration when you are looking for inbound links. Whilst this is by no means a reliable indicator of the value of a link, it does give you some indication and I think it would be fair to say that a link from a page with a pagerank of 4 or more is much better than a link with no pagerank.</p>

<p>The other major factor that you need to take into consideration is the anchor text of the link that you place. The anchor text is the visible text that people can actually click on to visit your page. To promote your rabbit products page, you really want to try to get the word rabbit in there. So for example &lt;a href=&ldquo;mysite.com/rabbit-page.html&rdquo;&gt;Buy Rabbit Stuff&lt;/a&gt; is much better than &lt;a href=&ldquo;mysite.com/rabbit-page.html&rdquo;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Build Links?</strong></p>

<p>This is the big question and unfortunatley there are no easy answers. Various link building oppportunities tend to crop up, be over exploited and then become generally worthless, or much reduced in value. Where to build links really depends on the context that you are trying to build links for.</p>
