    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are using Name based virtual hosts, you may want to simply block any bots etc that try to access your server by direct IP address. It&rsquo;s unlikely a real user would try to hit your server by using the actual IP address.</p>

<p>To do this, you can use this Virtual Host config:</p>

<p>```
<VirtualHost *:80></p>

<pre><code>ServerName 123.123.123.123
Redirect 403 /
ErrorDocument 403 "No"
DocumentRoot /dev/null/
UseCanonicalName Off
UserDir disabled
</code></pre>

<p></VirtualHost></p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Of course, please change the IP to the real server IP address(es)</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it, anyone trying to hit the server by IP address will get a simple 403 error.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are having issues with mod rewrite apparently abandoning sections of variables after encoded hashes then this could be your solution.</p>

<p>The use case is particularly clear when using mod_rewrite in front of a search engine (such as Solr which I am really enjoying working with at the moment).</p>

<p>Imagine someone search for a partcode ABC#123</p>

<p>This gets encoded to search/abc%23123</p>

<p>Your rewritten search term will then be mangled by Apache and your search script will only actually see ABC. That is of course a problem and the solution is not really clear.</p>

<p>After a bit of searching around I found the solution is to add a B flag to your mod_rewrite rule so that mod_rewrite will escape these characters so that they are cleanly passed through.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>```php</p>

<p>RewriteRule ^(.<em>)search/(.</em>)$ advanced_search_result.php?keywords=$2 [L,B]</p>

<p>```</p>

    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/apache/apache-mod-rewrite-escaped-slashes-problem-solution</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of our Magento SEO service, the first thing we do is to make sure there are no issues with the crawlability and general health of the clients web site.</p>

<p>Whilst working on the Google Webmaster Tools crawl errors for a client I noticed one specific and intruiging problem for which I couldn&rsquo;t immediately see the reason, everything looked to be set up perfectly.</p>

<p>Certain URLs were getting 404 responses. The URL was being parsed by mod_rewrite but everything looked fine so why was apache giving a 404?</p>

<p>The problem turns out to be that the URLs contain escaped slashes (eg search/KTA-mb667k2%2F2g),</p>

<p>The problem is that Apache actually handles the escaped slash and helpfully converts it to a real slash. That then means that it is trying to look in a sub folder that does not exist and hence the 404.</p>

<p>Chances are you don&rsquo;t want escaped slashes to really be thought of as real directory separating slashes, especially if you are using mod_rewrite.</p>

<p>The answer is a simple one liner to be added to your vhost.conf or httpd.conf.</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>AllowEncodedSlashes On</p>

<p>If you are trying to modify your mod_security configuration on a plesk server and have tried using htaccess files you have probably realised that it won&rsquo;t work. That&rsquo;s a good thing, it makes it harder for people to screw up your server by turning off this protection.</p>

<p>Instead the way to do it is to edit the vhost.conf file located in the conf folder in the domain / sub domain root (the folder containing the httpdocs folder).</p>

<p>You can apply any settings you want to this file and then run the following command to get Plesk to rebuild your httpd configuration including your new settings. This is working with Plesk the way it was intended to be used and is a better solution that the htaccess file approach.</p>

<p>The command to rebuild your Apache configuration when you make a change to the vhost.conf ssl_vhost.conf file is:
```</p>

<pre><code>    /usr/local/psa/admin/bin/websrvmng -a -v
</code></pre>

<p>```
This rebuilds the configuration for ALL virtual hosts. It shouldn&rsquo;t take more than a few seconds, obviously you then need to restart Apache.</p>
