<p>It&rsquo;s always tempting when  you are new to a framework or system to just roll your own functionality if the built in functionality is not obvious. I was nearly at that stage with Drupal 6 file uploads. Thankfully before I gave in I found this useful blog post which clearly states how Drupal&rsquo;s built in file upload functionality works. Sweet :&ndash;)</p>

<p>Working on a couple of custom Drupal modules at the moment and I have to say I&rsquo;m really enjoying working with the Drupal forms API. I really feel like I have a wealth of cool features at my disposal without any particular effort or complication. It&rsquo;s a very logical system that does what it does really quite well.</p>

<p>If only the Zend Framework forms component was this easy to use!</p>

<p>Working on a custom Drupal module in Netbeans and wondering how to get Netbeans to treat the file as a PHP file even though the extension is .module?</p>

<p>All you need to do is right click the file and select &ldquo;Open As&rdquo;. Then in the dialog box select the PHP option and that&rsquo;s it. Sorted.</p>

<p>For content or community driven websites I definitely recommend taking a close look at the PHP based open source package <b>Drupal</b>. Like other successful open source packages, one of it&rsquo;s key strengths is in the tremendous breadth of additional modules that are available allowing you to create your custom mixture of features specific to your site requirements.</p>

<p>A lot of very cool modules are available allowing you to put together a comprehensively fully featured site without requiring any real custom development work. Also applying a custom design to Drupal is really quite easy. For you this all means that Drupal represents a comparitively low cost option for a powerful, custom content based web site.</p>

<p>If you need some freelance Drupal development do get in touch with Edmonds Commerce today.</p>
