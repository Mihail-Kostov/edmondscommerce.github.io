<p>If your Gmail is really slow, don&rsquo;t forget you can always switch to basic HTML view. I suspect you will find that it works just as well and is blazingly fast compared to standard Gmail.</p>

<p>Its still running over HTTPS so there is no security concern. The only issue is that you will need to remember to manually refresh the page if you want to recheck your inbox. However if you use firefox you can simply install the checkgmail firefox addon which will let you know as soon as someone emails your gmail account anyway.</p>

<p>Well done to Google for giving the option of the basic HTML view. With all of this web 2.0 thin client revolution going on, I think performance has definitely taken a hit. Better browsers and faster internet will probably overcome all that in the future but for now its nice to be able to stay fast.</p>

<p>I know they have been around for a while now, but I am still impressed with Google Docs. Like watching someone else in real time as they edit a shared spreadsheet..</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s really cool isn&rsquo;t it!<h4>More&hellip;</h4></p>
