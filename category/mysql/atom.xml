    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you have a result set in MySQL that you need to order in a specific way you might think that it is not possible and instead you are going to have to read all
of your results into your application domain (eg PHP) and manage the sorting from there. On a large results set that could be seriously inefficient.</p>

<p>The truth is that you don&rsquo;t have to do that. You can specify any kind of sort order including sorting by string values as you see fit.</p>

<p>The way to do this is to use the magic of <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/string-functions.html#function_find-in-set">FIND_IN_SET</a> combined with ORDER BY.</p>

<p>For a full example see this query that is pulling out product images from a data repository in descending image size as described in one of the columns as a string.</p>

<p>``` mysql
SELECT
  dcl.prodID,
  dcl.contentGuid,
  dc.url,
  dcmv.metaValueName AS resolution
FROM cds_DigContent dc
  JOIN cds_DigContent_Links dcl</p>

<pre><code>ON (dc.contentGuid = dcl.contentGuid)
</code></pre>

<p>  JOIN cds_DigContent_Meta dcm</p>

<pre><code>ON (dcm.contentGuid = dc.contentGuid
    AND dcm.metaAtrId = 6)
</code></pre>

<p>  JOIN cds_DigContent_Meta_ValVoc dcmv</p>

<pre><code>ON (dcmv.metaValueId = dcm.metaValueId)
</code></pre>

<p>WHERE dc.mediaTypeId = 15</p>

<pre><code>  AND dcl.prodId = '{$this-&gt;getCnetProdID()}'
</code></pre>

<p>ORDER BY
  FIND_IN_SET(dcmv.metaValueName, &lsquo;2400 x 1800,1200 x 900,1024 x 768,800 x 600,640 x 480,400 x 300,200 x 150,75 x 75&rsquo;)</p>

<p>LIMIT 0, 1</p>

<p>```</p>

    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/mysql/mysql-substring-not-returning-anything-solution</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are puzzled why your simple usage of the MySQL SUBSTRING() function is not returning anything this could be your solution.</p>

<p>The substring function allows you to specify a string (eg a column), the start character and the length. If you are used to languages like PHP then you are probably used to this kind of function regarding 0 as the starting character. In fact this function regards 1 as the starting character. If you specify 0 then you simply won&rsquo;t get any results.</p>

<p>This does not work:
```</p>

<p>SELECT SUBSTRING(column, 0, 10) as tenchars</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>This does work:
```</p>

<p>SELECT SUBSTRING(column, 1, 10) as tenchars</p>

<p>```</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Importing a database dump from one location using mysqldump, and them importing it into a blank database I received this error:</p>

<p>ERROR 1062 (23000) at line [Line No]: Duplicate entry for key &lsquo;[Key Name]&rsquo;</p>

<p>The issue here is that a constraint is set up to prevent two rows containing the same value. Although key checks are disabled, it still can&rsquo;t add the rows. Sometimes as a useful technique to just get it running locally (obviously there&rsquo;s an issue here which does need resolving), simply change the &ldquo;INSERT INTO&rdquo; statement to &ldquo;INSERT IGNORE INTO&rdquo;, which will skip that entry.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have recently been running some MySql scripts that wrote to a file.</p>

<p>These worked fine locally, but as soon as I deployed them I started to get the error above.</p>

<p>After much looking around I came across this solution.</p>

<p>When I was developing locally, I was connecting with a user that had global privileges. When I was running the code on the server I was connecting with a user that only had privileges for the database I was using.</p>

<p>The issue is that then FILE privilege is a Global setting, so the user did not have access to it, hence the access denied message.</p>

<p>Grant FILE privileges and you can connect as expected</p>

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/mysql/mysql-5-1-to-5-5-migration.html"/>
    <updated>2012-09-18T11:09:09+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/mysql/mysql-5-1-to-5-5-migration</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>According to pretty much every source there&rsquo;s only one sensible way to migrate from 5.0, 5.1 or 5.2 to 5.5 of mysql (or mariadb/percona for that matter), and it&rsquo;s not pretty (for a server with only two active magento installations for instance, this will take about 3 hours).</p>

<p>The answer is that you have to do an sql dump and restore.  This does take an age but does at least provide the reassurance that you are going to have nice clean databases after the upgrade.</p>

<p>So the commands are :&ndash;
```bash</p>

<p>mysqldump &mdash;all-databases &mdash;routines &mdash;events > fulldump.sql
mysqldump mysql &mdash;tables user > users.sql</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Then upgrade mysql binaries to 5.5 and empty the database directory &ndash; such as /var/lib/mysql and start mysql with it&rsquo;s script (e.g. /etc/init.d/mysql start).   Note, if you&rsquo;re using a distribution that doesn&rsquo;t come with start scripts, you may want to run mysql_install as root before starting mysql however you start it.</p>

<p>Then the following will restore the databases and users :
```bash</p>

<p>mysql -u root # add -p if you set up a default password when upgrading/installing 5.5
\r mysql
source users.sql
source fulldump.sql
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
\q</p>

<p>```</p>
