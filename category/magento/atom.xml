    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have recently been carring out a code audit on a Magento site. The site had some performance issues, and I wanted to see if there were any obvious problems.</p>

<p>One of the things that I wanted to check was the number of observers that were being used as there were a large number of extensions installed.</p>

<p>After looking for a quick way to do this I came across <a href="http://magerun.net/">Magerun</a>, which will generate a table of all of the obsevers and the methods that they are called against.</p>

<p>There are a lot of other realy useful things that it can do, so I would recommend that Magento Developers check it out on <a href="https://github.com/netz98/n98-magerun">github</a></p>
