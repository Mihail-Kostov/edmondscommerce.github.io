    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are using Firefox browser on Linux Mint you might have notice that the default search engine is not Google but DuckDuckGo.</p>

<p>DuckDuckGo are presenting themselves as the biggest threat to Google search engine bringing as the main advantage more privacy than what Google currently offer.</p>

<p>If you are happy with it than you are fine but if you feel like me that DuckDuckGo might have some interesting features, it does not bring the same result or way of using internet than Google search engine then you might want to come back to Google then please follow the below step by step procedure:</p>

<pre><code>Type about:config in the location bar and press Enter

Type keyword.URL in filter

Change the keyword.URL value to:

http://www.google.co.uk/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sourceid=navclient&amp;gfns=1&amp;q=
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that help.</p>

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/linux%20mint/how-to-restore-hibernate-after-deleting-and-recreating-your-swap-partition-in-mint-13-mint-14-and-ubuntu-12-04-ubuntu-12-10.html"/>

    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/linux%20mint/how-to-restore-hibernate-after-deleting-and-recreating-your-swap-partition-in-mint-13-mint-14-and-ubuntu-12-04-ubuntu-12-10</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of increasing my swap space in order to hibernate (my previous setup had 4GB of swap but 8GB of RAM) I had deleted and recreated my swap partition. There was no change in the partition&rsquo;s device files &ndash; it was still /dev/sda2, however my new swap partition seemed to be nonfunctional. This is down to the device&rsquo;s UUID having changed.</p>

<h2>Finding your new UUID</h2>


<p>To find the new UUID, issue:</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>$ ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll get this output. Just copy the UUID (the string of random letters and numbers), we&rsquo;ll use this soon</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Dec 21 14:27 13823b29-79f5-485f-a260-ba4c4c7f2d92 &ndash;> ../../sda1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Dec 21 14:27 65056fdc-e6e7-4ed5-aa9b-9cc7f1bc2e69 &ndash;> ../../sda2</p>

<p>```</p>

<h2>Fixing swap on bootup</h2>


<p>You&rsquo;ll find that the new swap partition isn&rsquo;t available on boot, nor can it be manually enabled using sudo swapon -a. To fix these, use your favourite text editor to open /etc/fstab and add the new UUID on the swap line
```</p>

<p>UUID=65056fdc-e6e7-4ed5-aa9b-9cc7f1bc2e69 none            swap    sw              0       0</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Issue a sudo swapon -a and check your System Monitor. If you have available swap then you&rsquo;re all good</p>

<h2>Fixing hibernate</h2>


<p>Because fstab is used way after the system decides whether to resume from Hibernate you&rsquo;ll need to update it on which partition it should resume from</p>

<p>Again, use your favourite text editor to open /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume. Add in your new UUID
```</p>

<p>RESUME=UUID=65056fdc-e6e7-4ed5-aa9b-9cc7f1bc2e69</p>

<p><code>
Update your configuration for it to take effect, and hibernate will work just fine again
</code></p>

<p>sudo update-initramfs -u</p>

<p>```</p>

    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/linux/linux%20mint/how-to-get-compiz-working-with-linux-mint-13-maya-and-mate</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the Gnome world moving on to Gnome Shell and Unity some of us are finding frustrating  the lack of ability to tweak and configure afforded to us by Gnome 2. MATE has gone a long way to ensuring that we can continue to use the familiar desktop environment without the worry of using an outdated and insecure version of your favourite distribution.</p>

<p>One such area where an immense ability to configure our DE is Compiz which is no longer compatible with Gnome Shell. Using Compiz with MATE requires a little tweaking for it to work, but ultimately is as functional as it&rsquo;s always been.</p>

<h2>Setting configurations</h2>


<p><code>bash
compiz --replace
</code>
Because Compiz is installed out of the box on Mint 13 (Maya), this does work. However you&rsquo;ll find yourself with ugly window decoration which doesn&rsquo;t fit in with your windows.</p>

<p><code>bash
mateconf-editor
</code>
Navigate to <strong>/desktop/mate/session/required_components/windowmanager</strong> and set the value to <strong>compiz</strong></p>

<p><code>bash
gconf-editor
</code>
Navigate to <strong>/apps/metacity/general/theme</strong> and set the value to your Metacity theme name. Mint&rsquo;s default is <strong>Mint-X</strong></p>

<h2>Setting up Compiz plugins</h2>


<p>You might find you need to tell Compiz to use the new Window Decorator. In CompizConfigSettingsManager you&rsquo;ll need to set the same into the Window Decoration plugin. Set the Command field to <strong>marco &mdash;replace</strong></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll need to enable some other Window Manager must-haves in the following plugins: <strong>Move Window</strong>, <strong>Resize Window</strong>, <strong>Grid</strong> and <strong>Application Switcher</strong> for alt+tab</p>

<p>This should be enough to get you going &ndash; I have the Scale plugin working (for Expos√© style window switching)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still a little rough around the edges &ndash; here&rsquo;s a few issues I still have, with solutions:</p>

<h2>Compiz occasionally crashes on MATE</h2>


<p>Switch to another tty (Ctrl+Alt+F1) and run
<code>bash
marco --replace -d 0:0
</code>
Once back in your X display, run alt+F2 and run compiz &mdash;replace again</p>

<h2>Workspace switching doesn't work in MATE</h2>


<p>Set the amount of workspaces you&rsquo;d like in CCSM > General Options > Desktop Size. Set your Horizontal Virtual Size and set Vertical Virtual Size to 1
Set your panel&rsquo;s workspace switcher to Number of Workspaces: 1</p>
