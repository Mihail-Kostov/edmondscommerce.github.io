    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You might not be aware that in Gnome Shell and likely anything else using Linux you can easily block sound from entire applications.</p>

<p>For me this means blocking annoying auto playing videos with sound that are cropping up as I&rsquo;m trying to listen to some nice tunes whilst I work.</p>

<p>To block the sound is very easy, simply go to the sound control panel which in Gnome Shell is access via the top right panel.</p>

<p>Once into the sound section, go to the right most tab where you can control sounds on an application by application basis. Simply turn off the annoying onces.</p>

<p>Beautiful :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Came across an interesting Github project today &ndash; a command line text editor that is designed to look and feel and largely behave like a GUI text editor such as Sublime.</p>

<p>Meet <a href="https://github.com/slap-editor/slap">Slap</a></p>

<p>Installation is trivial assuming you already have node installed:</p>

<p><code>
npm -g install slap
</code></p>

<p>Once its installed you can open any file as you would with any other cli text editor</p>

<p><code>
slap my-file.php
</code></p>

<p>Immediate impressions are quite positive. A familiar feeling file browser in the left column is coupled with a text editing pane on the right that responds well to mouse clicks and familiar key presses.
The text highlighting is very nice and things like brace matching are also included.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me it seems that mouse usage often lead to garbage characters being inserted into the text which render it unusable for the moment though this could be an issue specific to my machine.</p>

<p>Definitely a project to keep an eye on though if you like trying new CLI text editors. That said I&rsquo;m writing this post in SPF13 Vim which I&rsquo;m pretty happy with :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As someone who types a lot of text everyday and am generally quite keen not to lose my work, I tend to hit the key combination [Ctrl]+[S] quite a lot.
In fact its almost become muscle memory that every sentence or two I will hit that combination.</p>

<p>When working on a terminal, this can have the unfortunate outcome that the terminal freezes up. For more time than I would like to admit, I thought that this was a Linux bug
And found myself frequently restarting terminal sessions that had locked up.</p>

<p>Then I discovered that you can unlock this when it freezes by hitting [Ctrl]+[Q]. However this is a bit of a pain.</p>

<p>I have now discovered a way of turning off this behaviour completely which is a real relief. Simply add the following to your .bashrc file:</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>Prevent Ctrl+S Freezing Terminal</h1>

<p>stty -ixon
```</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have a large database file to import or any other longer running process that involves piping data from one place to another then this little utility should definitely be in your arsenal.</p>

<p>Simply enough you use this to give you a progress indication when you are piping large amounts of data.</p>

<p>To use this on a mysql import (which is where I am most likely to use this) you would do the following:</p>

<p><code>bash
pv ./dumpfile.sql | mysql -u$USER -p$PASS dbname
</code></p>

<p>This will then give you a simple progress bar and very usefully, an ETA that indicates how much time is left For example:
<code>
 308MB 0:07:57 [ 216kB/s] [===============&gt;                                          ] 10% ETA 1:08:32
</code></p>

<p>To install the utility you should first of all just try <code>yum install pv</code>. If that doesn&rsquo;t work then you can read more about installing for your distribution here:

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are constantly frustated by Vim freezing up on you are editing a file on a server then this is quite possibly your problem, and your solution.</p>

<p>The issue is that most text editors and IDEs have [ctrl]+[s] mapped to save. If you do a lot of file editing then you probably bash the [ctrl]+[s] combo all the time, without even thinking about it&hellip;</p>

<p>Now back to Vim. As it is running in the terminal then it can be frozen by using the [ctrl]+[s] combination. You probably weren&rsquo;t aware of that feature.</p>

<p>To bring things back to life, just hit the [ctrl]+[q] combo. There are ways to permanently disable this which you can try.</p>

<p>For full information on this, check out this great <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12107/how-to-unfreeze-after-accidentally-pressing-ctrl-s-in-a-terminal" target="_blank">stack exchange page</a>.</p>
