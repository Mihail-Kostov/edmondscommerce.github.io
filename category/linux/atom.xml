    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As someone who types a lot of text everyday and am generally quite keen not to lose my work, I tend to hit the key combination [Ctrl]+[S] quite a lot.
In fact its almost become muscle memory that every sentence or two I will hit that combination.</p>

<p>When working on a terminal, this can have the unfortunate outcome that the terminal freezes up. For more time than I would like to admit, I thought that this was a Linux bug
And found myself frequently restarting terminal sessions that had locked up.</p>

<p>Then I discovered that you can unlock this when it freezes by hitting [Ctrl]+[Q]. However this is a bit of a pain.</p>

<p>I have now discovered a way of turning off this behaviour completely which is a real relief. Simply add the following to your .bashrc file:</p>

<p>```</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have a large database file to import or any other longer running process that involves piping data from one place to another then this little utility should definitely be in your arsenal.</p>

<p>Simply enough you use this to give you a progress indication when you are piping large amounts of data.</p>

<p>To use this on a mysql import (which is where I am most likely to use this) you would do the following:</p>

<p><code>bash
pv ./dumpfile.sql | mysql -u$USER -p$PASS dbname
</code></p>

<p>This will then give you a simple progress bar and very usefully, an ETA that indicates how much time is left For example:
<code>
 308MB 0:07:57 [ 216kB/s] [===============&gt;                                          ] 10% ETA 1:08:32
</code></p>

<p>To install the utility you should first of all just try <code>yum install pv</code>. If that doesn&rsquo;t work then you can read more about installing for your distribution here:

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are constantly frustated by Vim freezing up on you are editing a file on a server then this is quite possibly your problem, and your solution.</p>

<p>The issue is that most text editors and IDEs have [ctrl]+[s] mapped to save. If you do a lot of file editing then you probably bash the [ctrl]+[s] combo all the time, without even thinking about it&hellip;</p>

<p>Now back to Vim. As it is running in the terminal then it can be frozen by using the [ctrl]+[s] combination. You probably weren&rsquo;t aware of that feature.</p>

<p>To bring things back to life, just hit the [ctrl]+[q] combo. There are ways to permanently disable this which you can try.</p>

<p>One of the things that was I needed to install was an up to date version of Sun Java. However, for various reasons, this no longer appears in the official repos.</p>

<p>Thankfully there is a different repo available here <a href="http://www.duinsoft.nl/packages.php?t=en" title="http://www.duinsoft.nl/packages.php?t=en" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.duinsoft.nl/packages.php?t=en">http://www.duinsoft.nl/packages.php?t=en</a></a> where you can download the latest version and ensure that it is updated</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I upgrade my laptop to the latest release of Linux Mint 14 MATE edition. Everything is working beautifully apart from the wireless which, whilst functional, was cripplingly slow.</p>

<p>After a load of searching and testing, the solution that worked for me was:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<p>sudo -s</p>

<p>iwconfig wlan0 rate 54M</p>

<p>echo &ldquo;options ath9k nohwcrypt=1&rdquo; > /etc/modprobe.d/ath9k.conf</p>

<p>reboot</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>If you copy and paste the above into a terminal it will force the wifi speed to 54M and will make sure hardware crypt is disabled and finally reboot your machine.</p>

<p>I did this and my wifi speed is now perfectly fast, I&rsquo;m a happy bunny :)</p>
