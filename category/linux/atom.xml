    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>SELinux provides a secure and fine grained way of controlling permissions for applications running on Linux. It moves beyond simple users and groups to something a lot more granular.</p>

<p>By default SELinux is configured expecting Apache to be using /var/www as its document root.</p>

<p>If you are using an alternative document root then you might find that Apache is unable to write to folders, even though permissions are correctly configured.</p>

<p>If this is the case, you might think that you should disable SELinux, however a better solution is to correctly configure it.</p>

<p>First of all you should double check what types http has:</p>

<p><code>bash
semanage fcontext -l | grep http
</code></p>

<p>We specifically need read/write access so lets grep for that:</p>

<p><code>bash
semanage fcontext -l | grep http | grep rw
</code></p>

<p>For me that shows the type: httpd_sys_rw_content_t</p>

<p>We now need to add this to our custom document root:</p>

<p><code>bash
semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t ‘/opt/Projects(/.*)?’
restorecon -R -v /opt/Projects/
</code>
And then you should be able to run your sites from any folder you like without having to resort to disabling SELinux</p>

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/linux/nice-gnome-shell-theme-elegance-colours.html"/>
    <updated>2014-10-02T09:11:11+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/linux/nice-gnome-shell-theme-elegance-colours</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the nice features of Gnome Shell is that, with the help of the <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes/">User Theme</a> extension, you can really customise
your desktop experience to be something personalised.</p>

<p>For me, the first thing is to set my desktop background to be a nice picture &ndash; something with wide open spaces, mountains and lots of sky.</p>

<p>The next thing though is to set up a user theme. I like transparency and themes that allow my well chosen background image to shine through.</p>

<p>For this reason I chose the <a href="https://github.com/satya164/elegance-colors">Elegance Colors</a> theme as it has a &ldquo;clear&rdquo; preset which also includes functionality to set the colour scheme based
on the background image which is pretty slick I think.</p>

<p>For installation instructions, please see the <a href="https://github.com/satya164/elegance-colors/blob/master/README.md">README on Github</a></p>

<h2>Quick Fedora instructions are here:</h2>

<h3>Create Repo</h3>

<p>``` bash
sudo sh -c &ldquo; echo &lsquo;[home_satya164_elegance-colors]
name=Elegance Colors Gnome Shell theme (Fedora_20)
type=rpm-md
baseurl=<a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/satya164:/elegance-colors/Fedora_20/">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/satya164:/elegance-colors/Fedora_20/</a>
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=<a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/satya164:/elegance-colors/Fedora_20/repodata/repomd.xml.key">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/satya164:/elegance-colors/Fedora_20/repodata/repomd.xml.key</a>
enabled=1&rsquo; > /etc/yum.repos.d/elegance-colors.repo&rdquo;</p>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Install Theme</h3>

<p><code>bash
sudo yum install gnome-shell-theme-elegance-colors
</code></p>

<h3>Run the Setup</h3>

<p><code>
elegance-colors
</code></p>

<h3>Switch to the Theme</h3>

<p>``` bash
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.user-theme name &lsquo;elegance-colors&rsquo;</p>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Now run the GUI and set it up</h3>

<p>For this you can hit simply search for &lsquo;Elegance Colors&rsquo; from the dash to load the GUI.</p>

<p>In the GUI you have presets and if you want transparency just choose the clear one. After that of course you can customise as you see fit</p>

<h2>Fonts</h2>

<p>To make the most of Fedora, its well worth following <a href="http://worldofgnome.org/how-to-greatly-improve-font-rendering-under-fedora-20/">these instructions</a> to improve font rendering.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You might not be aware that in Gnome Shell and likely anything else using Linux you can easily block sound from entire applications.</p>

<p>For me this means blocking annoying auto playing videos with sound that are cropping up as I&rsquo;m trying to listen to some nice tunes whilst I work.</p>

<p>To block the sound is very easy, simply go to the sound control panel which in Gnome Shell is access via the top right panel.</p>

<p>Once into the sound section, go to the right most tab where you can control sounds on an application by application basis. Simply turn off the annoying onces.</p>

<p>Beautiful :)</p>

    <link href="http://edmondscommerce.github.io/linux/gui-editor-alike-terminal-editor.html"/>
    <updated>2014-07-30T17:50:40+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/linux/gui-editor-alike-terminal-editor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Came across an interesting Github project today &ndash; a command line text editor that is designed to look and feel and largely behave like a GUI text editor such as Sublime.</p>

<p>Meet <a href="https://github.com/slap-editor/slap">Slap</a></p>

<p>Installation is trivial assuming you already have node installed:</p>

<p><code>
npm -g install slap
</code></p>

<p>Once its installed you can open any file as you would with any other cli text editor</p>

<p><code>
slap my-file.php
</code></p>

<p>Immediate impressions are quite positive. A familiar feeling file browser in the left column is coupled with a text editing pane on the right that responds well to mouse clicks and familiar key presses.
The text highlighting is very nice and things like brace matching are also included.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me it seems that mouse usage often lead to garbage characters being inserted into the text which render it unusable for the moment though this could be an issue specific to my machine.</p>

<p>Definitely a project to keep an eye on though if you like trying new CLI text editors. That said I&rsquo;m writing this post in SPF13 Vim which I&rsquo;m pretty happy with :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As someone who types a lot of text everyday and am generally quite keen not to lose my work, I tend to hit the key combination [Ctrl]+[S] quite a lot.
In fact its almost become muscle memory that every sentence or two I will hit that combination.</p>

<p>When working on a terminal, this can have the unfortunate outcome that the terminal freezes up. For more time than I would like to admit, I thought that this was a Linux bug
And found myself frequently restarting terminal sessions that had locked up.</p>

<p>Then I discovered that you can unlock this when it freezes by hitting [Ctrl]+[Q]. However this is a bit of a pain.</p>

<p>I have now discovered a way of turning off this behaviour completely which is a real relief. Simply add the following to your .bashrc file:</p>

<p>```</p>
