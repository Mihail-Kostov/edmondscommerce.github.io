<p>Its easy sometimes to focus entirely on the front end features of your web site or ecommerce business. Without a doubt the front end is the most imporant part of your web site as it needs to work well to allow your visitors to find and purchase what they are looking for.</p>

<p>However, the back end of your ecommerce site also needs some investment putting into it. A well designed and implemented back end will mean that your customers get better customer services and your staff are happier and therefore more cheerful and better at making your customers happy.</p>

<p>A well designed back office system will have the utmost automation built in, which means that your staff costs are lower and the capacity for human error to upset the flow of your business is minimised. Naturally it is the most mundane and boring tasks which are the most ripe for automation. This means that your staff are happier as they can concentrate on the tasks that really do require a human mind to be dealt with effectively.</p>

<p>The other major aspect of a well designed back end system is easily accessible and relevant information. This means that if your customer services operative takes a call from a customer who is chasing up an order, your operative can be looking at all of the relevant information within a couple of seconds, and can quickly determine the current status and advise the customer with accurate and up to date information.</p>

<p>It also means that as a manager, you can have access to performance indicators and other management information just as easily. This will allow you to quickly spot and diagnose problems and take action to fix current problems and prevent future problems.</p>

<p>All of this means a better bottom line.</p>
