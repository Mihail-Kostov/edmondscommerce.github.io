  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>There is a problem in Magento that when you try to move a category by dragging it in the admin, it can cause the above error, whilst causing the rest of the site to slow down.</p>

<p>This is caused by the system trying to re-index every product within the space of a transaction.</p>

<p>An easy way to get round this is to switch the indexing mode from auto to manual and then move the categories.</p>

<p>You will still need to re-index the site, but this can be run on a cron when the site is quite.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>If you have switched to Gnome Shell or Gnome 3 then you are no doubt making a lot of use of the overview and alt tab functionality to switch between your windows.</p>

<p>To make this easier (if you have a mouse with extra buttons) you can map your extra buttons to do these actions with a few simple tools.</p>

<p>Firstly you need to install xbindkeys and xdotool</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><figcaption class='panel-heading'><h3 class='panel-title'></h3></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install xbindkeys xdotool
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you need to know your mouse buttons, try running this command:</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><figcaption class='panel-heading'><h3 class='panel-title'></h3></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>xev | grep button
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will give you a window you can click on with your mouse and it will tell you which button you clicked.</p>

<p>Then finally you need to edit your xbindkeys configuration. This is my xbindkeys config:</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><figcaption class='panel-heading'><h3 class='panel-title'></h3></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c">#gnome shell button 8 to alt tab</span>
</span><span class='line'>&amp;quot;xdotool keydown alt key Tab; sleep 2; xdotool keyup alt&amp;quot;
</span><span class='line'>release + b:8
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">#gnome shell button 9 to overview</span>
</span><span class='line'>&amp;quot;xdotool key Super_L&amp;quot;
</span><span class='line'>release + b:9
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Like most frameworks and software packages PrestaShop has it&rsquo;s own way of handling session variables.</p>

<p>PrestaShop uses the Cookie class to manage session variables. While this isn&rsquo;t strictly a singleton you can get a pre initialised instance using Context::getContected->cookie if the FrontController->init() method has been called already.</p>

<p>The Cookie class uses the magic <strong>get </strong>isset <strong>set </strong>unset magic methods to handle parameters. Parameters set in the cookie are actually given to the client in an encrypted blob. This is good because it means sessions are not really stored on the server. This does mean, however, that only scalar values can be stored in the session. To store non-scalar values you can usually get away with serialising them but there are some restrictions even then. If you do struggle to store serialised values you can base64 encode them to fix any remaining issues.</p>

<p>Once you have set your variables you need to call the write method to save your variables to the cookie.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><h2>What DNS is</h2>


<p><strong>DNS (Domain Name System)</strong> is the system used to make sure that when users type in your web address into their browser, they end up on your website.</p>

<h2>How communication happens on the internet</h2>


<p>When using the web, every site has its own address. It might have extra bits on the start and end, but the core part will be &ldquo;yoursitename.com&rdquo;, or similar. This is your <strong>Domain Name</strong>.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, servers have a unique number assigned to them, similar to how houses have phone numbers. This will look something like &ldquo;123.456.789.000&rdquo;. This is called an <strong>IP Address</strong>.</p>

<p>Like phone numbers, the problem with IP addresses is that they&rsquo;re hard to remember. It&rsquo;s not easy to tell other people a list of numbers and have them remember them when they get home. It&rsquo;s for this reason we have phone books. Fortunately the internet has its own built in way of looking up IP addresses by a name. This is where DNS comes in.</p>

<p>DNS is a way of looking up an IP address by a more memorable name. When you type in &ldquo;google.com&rdquo; it&rsquo;s actually being converted into an IP address without you realising.</p>

<h2>How Domain Names are converted into IP Addresses</h2>


<p>When you buy your domain from your registrar, you will also be provided an area where you can set up <strong>DNS Records, also called Zone Records</strong>. This is where you, or your development company, set up the conversion from the Domain Name to the IP address. When this is populated, people accessing your domain are able to end up on your server because of this translation.</p>

<p>In actual fact, this information is spread across the world so that every <strong>DNS Server</strong> in the world (a place where the translation happens) knows what your IP address is, exactly like sharing a phone book with the world.</p>

<p>This translation information is transmitted with a validity period, which is how often other DNS Servers should ask for updates. This is called a &ldquo;Time To Live&rdquo;, or TTL). This is generally set to a relatively high time, and is the reason you generally have a 24 hour wait period when you change where your site is hosted.</p>

<h2>Separating your Domain Registrar from your Name Server</h2>


<p>It&rsquo;s possible (and not unusual) to have the <strong>Domain Registrar</strong> (the company you bought the domain from) and the <strong>Name Server</strong> (the place where you update these DNS records) in completely different places. This is set up by telling your Registrar where your Name Servers are.</p>

<p>When this is changed, it means that the Registrar is no longer in control of the translation from Domain Name to IP Address</p>

<h2>The General Overview</h2>


<p>So when you access a website, here is what&rsquo;s actually happening behind the scenes</p>

<ul>
<li>You type in the web address into your browser</li>
<li>Your browser asks a DNS Server what the corresponding IP address is</li>
<li>The DNS server sends the IP address back to your computer</li>
<li>Your browser then knows which specific IP address to send subsequent messages to</li>
<li>The browser takes this IP adress and sends a message to the server it&#8217;s assigned to for the web page</li>
<li>The server sends back the page to your computer, and it&#8217;s displayed on your screen</li>
</ul>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>If you use SagePay Form integration then you might think that it is impossible to release orders created via this integration system via the API.</p>

<p>Historically this was true however thanks to the new admin and reporting API you can now grab all of the details you need to perform the kind of admin side integration previously only possible via Server and Direct integrations.</p>

<p>This does take a bit of work but if you like the fact that Form alleviates PCI compliance issues, allows your customers to use the nice easy to use Form interface and also gives you easy PayPal integration then this is a great solution.</p>

<p>Thanks goes out to SagePay&rsquo;s technical support who have proved really helpful in ironing out the kinks in getting this working.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>PrestaShop is a fully featured shopping platform and offers much of the functionality that other eCommerce shopping platforms do. Compared to, for example, Magento PrestaShop is significantly simpler to develop for.</p>

<p>Here is the run down of the key aspects that any one building a web site on PrestaShop should be aware of.</p>

<h2>Modules</h2>


<p>PrestaShop is based around a modular design which is quite similar to Joomlas module system.
A modules presence and position on the front end is defined by hooking the module into a particular section on the frontend. There are loads of hooks that can be used. Most modules will add them selves to the hook they think is most appropriate on install. The ordering of modules also defines the order they appear in a given hook.
A key point of managing modules that can easily be over looked is that you can grab and drag modules in a given hook by clicking and holding the position change buttons.</p>

<h2>Themes</h2>


<p>Off the shelf themes are usually not simply a new set of templates and CSS but also modules as well. Quite allot of themes are built around specific modules being in specific hooks some times in a specific order.</p>

<h2>Creating your own module</h2>


<p>Defining your own module is really straight forward:
Create a folder in modules called my_module.
Create a file called my_module.php, in this file create a class called My_module which extends Module.
Create a config.xml with the following template:
&lt;?xml version=&ldquo;1.0&rdquo; encoding=&ldquo;UTF-8&rdquo; ?>
<module></p>

<pre><code>&lt;name&gt;my_module&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;displayName&gt;My Module&lt;/displayName&gt;
&lt;version&gt;1&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;description&gt;A test module, it does nothing&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;author&gt;My self&lt;/author&gt;
&lt;tab&gt;front_office_features&lt;/tab&gt;
&lt;is_configurable&gt;0&lt;/is_configurable&gt;
&lt;need_instance&gt;1&lt;/need_instance&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></module>
Done, the module will appear in the module list but do nothing. You can look at the base module class to see all the function available that get called by PrestaShop are different times to do what you need to do.</p>
