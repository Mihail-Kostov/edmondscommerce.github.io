<p>There is a lot of buzz at the moment surrounding VPS hosting. For those of you who are not familiar with VPS, or virtual private server hosting &ndash; it is similar to shared hosting in that you are sharing a physical server with other web sites. The big difference is that with a VPS, you are not sharing the operating system with those other sites.</p>

<p>To clarify this. Think of your desktop PC and think of web sites as separate windows running Word for example (this is just to illustrate the idea). Each instance of Word is a separate entity but they are all running on the same instance of windows and are all running on the same machine. There are some security issues with this idea, for example someone elses instance of word might be able to get access to your folder with your files in it.</p>

<p>On a VPS, there is only your instance of word running in your instance of windows. And only you can access your files. From your point of view, the VPS operates exactly as if it was a dedicated server. You have total control over every single bit of the operating system and can install whatever software you wish and make any changes that you would like.</p>

<p>Also &ndash; VPS solutions tend to offer better protection against the physical server resources being hogged by one particularly demanding account at the cost of all the other accounts on the server. Instead on VPS systems, the resources are more rigidly shared out meaning that you have a guaranteed minimum level of performance that can not be degraded no matter how hard other VPS&rsquo;s on the physical server are being used.</p>

<p>This all sounds great, and for many people it is. However there is a big BUT&hellip;</p>

<p>The drawback with VPS hosting is in the support. Often these VPS accounts are available very cheaply and when they are working they can work really well. The problem arises when they stop working. You go to the hosting company and ask them why the server has stopped working and they tell you that they do not support the software and its your responsibility to sort it out.</p>

<p>At this point, the average person who just wanted a hosting environment for their web site and is not an experienced systems administrator can come really unstuck because you simply might not be able to fix the problem.</p>

<p>With dedicated server hosting, many hosts offer something called Managed hosting. This is where you not only get the machine but you also get a full support service and ongoing management to keep the machine up to date with the latest patches and security updates and also get the machine up and running again should there be any problems. If you can afford this kind of service then I highly recommend going for it, but it is significantly more expensive than VPS hosting.</p>

<p>So to conclude, if you do not regard yourself as an experienced systems administrator then I would highly recommend you double check the level of support offered with the VPS before you sign up for it. For UK based readers, I would especially recommend avoiding web fusion VPS servers.</p>

<p>If you need any help finding a suitable hosting solution for your online business &ndash; get in touch today.</p>

<p>osCommerce is undoubtedly the most popular open source ecommerce system available today. It has been around for a long time and whilst this does mean that it is not particularly cutting edge in the way it is put together, it also means that it is tried and tested and guaranteed to work well.</p>

<p>One of the other great things about osCommerce is the fact that it has also spawned various offshoots or forks. Most notably these include Zen Cart and CRELoaded. There are a few other less well know osCommerce offshoots as well. These are basically packages that have taken the base osCommerce system and added a selection of customisations and extra features to make it a more complete package.</p>

<p>My particular preference is the CRELoaded version of osCommerce. This version includes an excellent templating system making it very easy to get the store to look exactly how you want with minimal fuss. It also includes some excellent catalogue management tools including the incredibly useful and powerful easypopulate system. This system allows you to edit your products via spreadsheet. With a little modification it can handle bulk insertions of tens or even hundreds of thousands of products.</p>

<p>Edmonds Commerce are a freelance PHP development specialist and have years of experience with all flavours of osCommerce. If you have any customisation, optimisation or SEO requirements for your existing osCommerce store, or if you are looking to set up a new ecommerce site based around osCommerce &ndash; Simply get in touch.</p>

<p>Many organisations choose to outsource some or all of their SEO efforts. SEO is at once simple and also complicated. The basic principles are simple enough, but if you do things slightly wrong then you may inadvertantly do something which is actually counter productive to your SEO efforts.</p>

<p>To combat spammy sites, search engines use various methods to check if a site is spammy or not. Unfortunately like any automated system there will always be false positives. What this means to you is that if you accidently do something which the search engines will regard as spammy, you might actually harm rather than help your search engine performance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are many organisations who market themselves as SEO professionals and offer SEO services, but will at best do you no good and at worst could actually trigger your site to be labelled as spammy by the search engines and get you penalised.</p>

<p>Today I received a well written email from a UK based company (I won&rsquo;t name names) offering a link building service with a free 30 day trial. Why not is the first instinct &ndash; a free trial is worth having I suppose.</p>

<p>Upon ringing the company and speaking to one of their represenatives, I quickly determined that this company is not one that I would like to be handling any aspect of my SEO efforts. Here are the things that got me worried:</p>

<p><strong>Searching Google for the company name did not bring them up</strong>
If nothing else, every web site should rank number one for its own name. I asked them about this and they told me that they do not want to rank in the search engines&hellip;? An SEO company that doesn&rsquo;t want to rank in the search engines&hellip;.</p>

<p><strong>Their website has a pagerank of 0 &ndash; a white bar in the Google Toolbar</strong>
Many people will tell you these days that pagerank is not important. In general I agree, however having no pagerank at all is a particularly bad sign, especially considering the fact that link building is intended to build link popularity which is pretty much what pagerank is about. For a link building company that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>

<p><strong>They were unwilling to offer any examples of sites that they have done SEO for</strong>
They quoted privacy for this which is fair enough, however I am sure that a happy client would not have any complaints if their site was used to demonstrate the value of the SEO companies services.</p>

<p><strong>They only place links on their own network of sites</strong>
This is where it starts to get really bad. The technique they use is widely acknowledged to be a spamming tactic which Google can detect and will penalise. Getting your link spread across this link farm will almost certainly get your site penalised.</p>

<p>A real link building company would search out sites that are &ldquo;out there&rdquo; on the internet that are in the same niche as your site and will try to get these sites to link back to your site. It&rsquo;s an incredibly difficult and laborious task which is why so many people outsource it.</p>

<p>I have looked into loads of different companies that offer a link building service and have yet to find one that actually does what it says on the tin. I have seen companies that simply add your link to a bunch of link farms that they control (as in this case) which is at best totally useless.</p>

<p>I have also seen companies who charge high monthly rates for links on an ongoing basis. All these guys are doing is simply renting links for you. This is another tactic which Google is going after in a big way. The value of hired links is now questionable. There is no real need to use a middle man for this service as there are plenty of link renting sites set up that you can organise your own link rentals should you decide to go down this path.</p>

<p>In my opinion any SEO tactic that requires ongoing payment to sustain is not real SEO. To me real SEO is like building a wall. Every action you do is another brick in the wall. Your wall gets bigger and stronger every day and with consistent effort you have built a nice solid house that brings consistent traffic with no ongoing investment.</p>

<p>To get the highest possible level of server security and to protect yourself from things like XSS attacks, Edmonds Commerce highly recommend you get mod_security set up on your server.</p>

<p>If you ask your hosts they should be able to do this for you.</p>

<p>You can read all about mod_security <a href="http://www.modsecurity.org/">here</a>. If you would like any help getting mod_security set up on your server then simply get in touch.</p>

<p>One thing we always recommend doing to the standard mod_security configuration is to increase the maximum body size. This restriction by default limits the size of any web page to 500k.</p>

<p>For front end pages, there should never be a time when you need to display a page bigger than this size, however for some administration side systems, it is necessary to create very big pages. This mod_security limit will prevent these pages from being viewable.</p>

<p>To remedy this, you need to edit the file located in the modsecurity.d sub folder of your httpd folder (usually /etc/httpd/modsecurity.d/)</p>

<p>In this folder there is a collection of files which handle all of the various security rules that detect potential security threats. There is also a file called modsecurity_crs_10_config.conf.</p>

<p>Edit this file using vi and change the value for the SecResponseBodyLimit setting. We usually recommend upping this to 2mb from the standard .5mb. This means that the server is protected from doing really big things (for example a mysql dump) but is able to display really big admin side HTML pages.</p>

<p>To set it to 2mb you need to change the value of SecResponseBodyLimit to 2097152</p>

<p>When doing spidering projects or other bulk catalogue management projects for osCommerce sites, I tend to finish by creating easypopulate format files so that the store owner can do any last minute edits and upload the products manually using the easypopulate system.</p>

<p>Creating easypopulate format files can be a bit of a chore, especially as every site seems to be slightly different with different columns etc.</p>

<p>For this reason, I have created a very easy to use easypopulate file creation class. You can read more about the class <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/4782.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>I have numerous clients who are now enjoying much, <i>much</i> easier management of their product catalogues including fully automated spidering systems that grab all details from supplier web sites and format it correctly to be uploaded to their store.</p>

<p>If you install the free version of CRELoaded, you will see that they have sneaked some Google adverts onto the bottom of your site.</p>

<p>Above the adverts will be the text</p>

<p><strong>This site is a member of the CRE Loaded Open Source Ecommerce Software community</strong></p>

<p>Bit of an underhand tactic but I suppose you have to try to make cash where you can these days&hellip;</p>

<p>I could go onto a big rant about how they are trying to make cash by simply repackaging software which was always meant to be given away freely and without hitches, including both osCommerce and the multitude of contributions they have added on there. I&rsquo;m not going to though. CRELoaded is a good product and these guys are keeping the osCommerce platform as a viable modern open source ecommerce platform.</p>

<p>Anyway &ndash; cut to the chase &ndash; to get rid of these annoying adverts all you have to do is open up</p>

<p>includes/javascript/cart_links.js.php</p>

<p>It should look like this:</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><figcaption class='panel-heading'><h3 class='panel-title'></h3></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>The ICECat database is an invaluable resource for webmasters who have to deal with very large catalogues. They offer a single source with a normalised structure for getting high quality images, descriptions and even PDF files about the products you sell.</p>

<p>They have developed relationships with a large number of manufacturers and brands which allow them to offer these details free of charge. If however you want better coverage they also offer a very reasonably priced service which is comparable to the CNET system but at a much reduced price.</p>

<p>Edmonds Commerce have the resources to implement a proper XML integration with the ICECat system for your ecommerce store. We especially specialse in the highly popular open source ecommerce platforms osCommerce and Magento.</p>

<p>If you would like to discuss the benefits of an ICECat integration please do not hesitate to get in touch.</p>

<p>Edmonds Commerce specialise in <strong>Magento Ecommerce</strong> and are available for <strong>Freelance Magento</strong> projects and installations. If you are looking to set up a new ecommerce venture and are considering using Magento &ndash; get in touch today.</p>

<p>Magento is certainly making waves. For those of you who haven&rsquo;t heard of it, Magento is looking likely to become the successor to osCommerce as the most popular open source ecommerce platform.</p>

<p>There are many things which make Magento a much better option than osCommerce. However for some people the tried and tested, &lsquo;better the devil you know&rsquo;, huge knowledge, customisation and support base of osCommerce  makes it the platform they would still prefer to put their development investment into.</p>

<p>These justifications are valid to a point, however I now believe that the time is right to move into Magento and whilst I am not certain that it is worth worrying about upgrading if you already have a perfectly functional osCommerce site, I would recommend anyone looking to set up a new ecommerce site takes a close look at Magento.</p>

<p>If you are coding a PHP script to deal with big files, it makes sense to build in some kind of caching logic so that your script won&rsquo;t download the same file every single time it is run, but will check to see how long ago it last downloaded that file and only download it again if it is more than a certain timeframe old.</p>

<p>This function allows you to do exactly that &ndash; check it out:</p>

<p>Handling directories and files with PHP is a snap. However, with this handy function you can always be sure that the destination directory path for your files will exist.</p>

<p>If you pass a path with a filename at teh end, set the second parameter to true eg make_path($path, true)</p>
