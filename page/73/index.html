<p>Many webmasters use Google Analytics to track their web traffic. This is a good idea and can be really useful in helping you to optimise your site and maximise your conversions.</p>

<p>However if your staff are constantly browsing your site, they will totally contaminate the data.</p>

<p>It is easy to block this though. All you need to do is add the following line to your HOSTS file</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># [Google Inc]
</span><span class='line'>127.0.0.1 www.google-analytics.com
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><b>Finding Your HOSTS file</b>
The hosts file is located in different locations in different operating systems and even in different Windows versions:</p>

<ul>
    <li> Windows NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista: %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\ is the default location, which may be changed. The actual directory is determined by the Registry key \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\DataBasePath.
   <li> Windows 95/98/Me: %WinDir%\
    <li> Linux and other Unix-like operating systems (including iPhone OS): /etc
    <li> Mac OS 9 and earlier: System Folder: Preferences or System folder (format of the file may vary from Windows and Linux counterparts)
   <li> Mac OS X: /private/etc (uses BSD-style Hosts file)
    <li> OS/2 and eComStation: &#8220;bootdrive&#8221;:\mptn\etc\
   <li> Symbian 1st/2nd edition phones: C:\system\data\hosts
    <li> Symbian 3rd edition phones: C:\private\10000882\hosts, only accessible with file browsers with AllFiles capability, most are not. 
</ul>

<p>For a webmaster that relies on their site as their source of income, such as an ecommerce shop &ndash; it can be terrible to see the site become unavailable.. if no one can access your site then you won&rsquo;t make any money!</p>

<p>However, sometimes its not that your site has gone down but that there is something wrong with your internet connection, your ISP or some higher level network problem that will affect some but not all of your sites visitors.</p>

<p>So next time your site goes down, visit <a href="http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/" rel="nofollow">this link</a> and check to see if you site is down or its just you!</p>

<p>The latest version (1.7) of Magento has been released and features native support of a real enterprise level ecommerce feature: A-B or Multivariate testing.</p>

<p>This involves presenting slightly different versions of pages to portions of web traffic and then monitoring the effectiveness of each version. This method then allows you to fine tune your site to maximise conversions and ultimately turnover.</p>

<p>The release also includes native Google Base integration meaning you can upload your product catalogue to Google&rsquo;s Base system (most usefully used in Google Product Search &ndash; A.K.A. Froogle).</p>

<p>These kind of hard hitting features really cement the fact that investing into a Magento based ecommerce platform is not just a sound decision for right now, but also a sound long term tactical decision for an ecommerce business.</p>

<p>There is probably no bigger decision you will make as a start up ecommerce business than which platform to invest in. Should I go for a paid for package? Should I go for the tried and tested package? Should I go for a hosted package?</p>

<p>I think the answer is becoming more and more &ndash; go for Magento!</p>

<p>When creating Javascript, it can be useful to alert out the values of various strings or arrays. You can also use this to confirm if certain parts of loops or if statements are being reached. However &ndash; having loads of alert statements in your Javascript can be messy and time consuming to manage.</p>

<p>For this reason I use this Javascript debug function. I use a PHP variable $debug to control whether or not this Javascript debug function outputs anything or not. If enabled, it will create an alert with info on the variable, array or whatever that has been passed to it.</p>

<p>If the $debug PHP variable is not set to true, the dbug function simply returns as soon as it is called &ndash; does nothing basically.</p>

<p>Here is the Javascript function</p>

<p>To use the function, first of all (assuming you are using PHP) you need to declare the $debug variable at the top of your script and set it to true:</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><figcaption class='panel-heading'><h3 class='panel-title'></h3></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;?</span><span class="nx">php</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$debug</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then in your Javascript simply use dbug(var) whenever you want something outputted.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><figcaption class='panel-heading'><h3 class='panel-title'></h3></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>There is a lot of buzz at the moment surrounding VPS hosting. For those of you who are not familiar with VPS, or virtual private server hosting &ndash; it is similar to shared hosting in that you are sharing a physical server with other web sites. The big difference is that with a VPS, you are not sharing the operating system with those other sites.</p>

<p>To clarify this. Think of your desktop PC and think of web sites as separate windows running Word for example (this is just to illustrate the idea). Each instance of Word is a separate entity but they are all running on the same instance of windows and are all running on the same machine. There are some security issues with this idea, for example someone elses instance of word might be able to get access to your folder with your files in it.</p>

<p>On a VPS, there is only your instance of word running in your instance of windows. And only you can access your files. From your point of view, the VPS operates exactly as if it was a dedicated server. You have total control over every single bit of the operating system and can install whatever software you wish and make any changes that you would like.</p>

<p>Also &ndash; VPS solutions tend to offer better protection against the physical server resources being hogged by one particularly demanding account at the cost of all the other accounts on the server. Instead on VPS systems, the resources are more rigidly shared out meaning that you have a guaranteed minimum level of performance that can not be degraded no matter how hard other VPS&rsquo;s on the physical server are being used.</p>

<p>This all sounds great, and for many people it is. However there is a big BUT&hellip;</p>

<p>The drawback with VPS hosting is in the support. Often these VPS accounts are available very cheaply and when they are working they can work really well. The problem arises when they stop working. You go to the hosting company and ask them why the server has stopped working and they tell you that they do not support the software and its your responsibility to sort it out.</p>

<p>At this point, the average person who just wanted a hosting environment for their web site and is not an experienced systems administrator can come really unstuck because you simply might not be able to fix the problem.</p>

<p>With dedicated server hosting, many hosts offer something called Managed hosting. This is where you not only get the machine but you also get a full support service and ongoing management to keep the machine up to date with the latest patches and security updates and also get the machine up and running again should there be any problems. If you can afford this kind of service then I highly recommend going for it, but it is significantly more expensive than VPS hosting.</p>

<p>So to conclude, if you do not regard yourself as an experienced systems administrator then I would highly recommend you double check the level of support offered with the VPS before you sign up for it. For UK based readers, I would especially recommend avoiding web fusion VPS servers.</p>

<p>If you need any help finding a suitable hosting solution for your online business &ndash; get in touch today.</p>

<p>osCommerce is undoubtedly the most popular open source ecommerce system available today. It has been around for a long time and whilst this does mean that it is not particularly cutting edge in the way it is put together, it also means that it is tried and tested and guaranteed to work well.</p>

<p>One of the other great things about osCommerce is the fact that it has also spawned various offshoots or forks. Most notably these include Zen Cart and CRELoaded. There are a few other less well know osCommerce offshoots as well. These are basically packages that have taken the base osCommerce system and added a selection of customisations and extra features to make it a more complete package.</p>

<p>My particular preference is the CRELoaded version of osCommerce. This version includes an excellent templating system making it very easy to get the store to look exactly how you want with minimal fuss. It also includes some excellent catalogue management tools including the incredibly useful and powerful easypopulate system. This system allows you to edit your products via spreadsheet. With a little modification it can handle bulk insertions of tens or even hundreds of thousands of products.</p>

<p>Edmonds Commerce are a freelance PHP development specialist and have years of experience with all flavours of osCommerce. If you have any customisation, optimisation or SEO requirements for your existing osCommerce store, or if you are looking to set up a new ecommerce site based around osCommerce &ndash; Simply get in touch.</p>

<p>Many organisations choose to outsource some or all of their SEO efforts. SEO is at once simple and also complicated. The basic principles are simple enough, but if you do things slightly wrong then you may inadvertantly do something which is actually counter productive to your SEO efforts.</p>

<p>To combat spammy sites, search engines use various methods to check if a site is spammy or not. Unfortunately like any automated system there will always be false positives. What this means to you is that if you accidently do something which the search engines will regard as spammy, you might actually harm rather than help your search engine performance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are many organisations who market themselves as SEO professionals and offer SEO services, but will at best do you no good and at worst could actually trigger your site to be labelled as spammy by the search engines and get you penalised.</p>

<p>Today I received a well written email from a UK based company (I won&rsquo;t name names) offering a link building service with a free 30 day trial. Why not is the first instinct &ndash; a free trial is worth having I suppose.</p>

<p>Upon ringing the company and speaking to one of their represenatives, I quickly determined that this company is not one that I would like to be handling any aspect of my SEO efforts. Here are the things that got me worried:</p>

<p><strong>Searching Google for the company name did not bring them up</strong>
If nothing else, every web site should rank number one for its own name. I asked them about this and they told me that they do not want to rank in the search engines&hellip;? An SEO company that doesn&rsquo;t want to rank in the search engines&hellip;.</p>

<p><strong>Their website has a pagerank of 0 &ndash; a white bar in the Google Toolbar</strong>
Many people will tell you these days that pagerank is not important. In general I agree, however having no pagerank at all is a particularly bad sign, especially considering the fact that link building is intended to build link popularity which is pretty much what pagerank is about. For a link building company that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>

<p><strong>They were unwilling to offer any examples of sites that they have done SEO for</strong>
They quoted privacy for this which is fair enough, however I am sure that a happy client would not have any complaints if their site was used to demonstrate the value of the SEO companies services.</p>

<p><strong>They only place links on their own network of sites</strong>
This is where it starts to get really bad. The technique they use is widely acknowledged to be a spamming tactic which Google can detect and will penalise. Getting your link spread across this link farm will almost certainly get your site penalised.</p>

<p>A real link building company would search out sites that are &ldquo;out there&rdquo; on the internet that are in the same niche as your site and will try to get these sites to link back to your site. It&rsquo;s an incredibly difficult and laborious task which is why so many people outsource it.</p>

<p>I have looked into loads of different companies that offer a link building service and have yet to find one that actually does what it says on the tin. I have seen companies that simply add your link to a bunch of link farms that they control (as in this case) which is at best totally useless.</p>

<p>I have also seen companies who charge high monthly rates for links on an ongoing basis. All these guys are doing is simply renting links for you. This is another tactic which Google is going after in a big way. The value of hired links is now questionable. There is no real need to use a middle man for this service as there are plenty of link renting sites set up that you can organise your own link rentals should you decide to go down this path.</p>

<p>In my opinion any SEO tactic that requires ongoing payment to sustain is not real SEO. To me real SEO is like building a wall. Every action you do is another brick in the wall. Your wall gets bigger and stronger every day and with consistent effort you have built a nice solid house that brings consistent traffic with no ongoing investment.</p>
