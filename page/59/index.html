<p>If you are using PHP5 on Ubuntu and are having strange issues with missing functions including <strong>imagerotate()</strong> then you have come up against the problems created by the Ubuntu/Debian packagers decision not to include the GD library included with PHP5 but instead include a more purist version of the GD library which unfortunatley has some missing components.</p>

<p>Just came across another useful keyword research tool.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/"><a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/">http://www.google.com/insights/search/</a></a></p>

<p>This is a bit like the google trends tool but with more detailed information. Handy helping to choose which variations of a search term to go for.</p>

<p>Varien have just released a new tool to help repair Magento databases. The system works by taking a reference database (a clean installation of the same Magento version your store is running) and comparing this to your live store DB.</p>

<p>It then goes through and repairs your store DB, fixing things like missing foreign keys etc.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t personally seen a requirement for this as yet, but if they have gone to the effort of releasing a tool I imagine it is because there is a requirement for this kind of tool. Definitely something to bear in mind if you ever do need to repair an Existing Magento database.</p>

<p>Google&rsquo;s latest incarnation, dubbed caffeine is set to improve further the quality of Google search results. The focus seems to be on more real time search, fresher content being boosted to the top of the rankings. So just when Microsoft thought they were giving Google a run for their money with Bing, Google take the game another leap forward. It does look like Google will continue to enjoy their near monopoly on search for the forseeable future.</p>

<p>For the average webmaster though its looking like an active fresh content creation programme is going to become an ever more important part of the overall SEO package. At Edmonds Commerce we have been working on setting up an outsourced fresh content service for our clients and will be rolling something out in full in the near future.</p>

<p>We recently launched our <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/blog/seo/link-building-service/">outsourced link building service</a> and fully intend to put together a collection of SEO services that can be outsourced as individual services or all together as a bulk package.</p>

<p>Fresh, original and regularly posted relevant content will become an SEO essential for any serious web site.</p>

<p>I have recently been working on shoehorning a large amount of data into a Google Adwords account for a client. Looking at setting up unique ads for around 50k products (targeting in stock products only so this is just a slice of the full catalogue size). I have managed to figure my way around the various Adwords limits and decided to use the adwords tool (running on a VirtualBox XP machine) to handle the bulk uploading.</p>

<p>I took a brief look at the API and then realised that you have to actually pay to use it! Forget that, already paying Google enough..</p>

<p>Anyway, now using the Adwords Edit Tool to upload the data and my god is it slow. I wonder if the API is as slow?</p>

<p>For the record &ndash; I found out that you can only have 25 campaigns. Each campaign can have up to 2000 ad groups inside it. Each ad group can contain an as yet undetermined amount of ads and keywords. You can&rsquo;t determine which keywords are displayed with which ad, but you can use dynamic keywords to allow you to effectively have one ad displaying a large number of keywords each with their own unique(ish) ad. Variable keyword lengths though cause pain with this approach.</p>

<p>Ultimately I have found making adwords do exactly what I want it to do to be an excercise in flexible, lateral thinking and generally working around the system rather than with it. That&rsquo;s never really as much fun and the whole thing has given me a new found respect for Amazons AMTU system. The real achilles heel of the Adwords Edit Tool is that you are going to need to manually run it every time, and if it runs this slow then forget about keeping a large amount of ads updated on a regular basis.</p>

<p>I am sure there are some hardcore Adwords abusers who could shed light on a few more sneaky tricks. I suspect a lot involve setting up multiple adwords accounts and that is something that I might consider.</p>

<p>Its been rumoured for ages but its finally happened, Yahoo and Microsoft have tied together and obviously the goal is to combine their forces to take on Google.</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;Through this agreement with Yahoo, we will create more innovation in search, better value for advertisers, and real consumer choice in a market currently dominated by a single company,&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>Said Steve Ballmer, head of Microsoft.</p>

<p>If you are struggling to connect to your IMAP mailboxes but other machines on the same network are working fine, then chances are you are hitting the rather restrictive max connections per IP setting that is the default with Courier IMAP and Plesk. As standard it is limited to only 4 connections per IP. For me that was taken up by one machine connecting to 2 inboxes and also running a mail notifier system (which of course doubled up the connections).</p>

<p>After nearly tearing my hair out, I stumbled across the following posts:</p>

<p><a href="http://kb.mediatemple.net/questions/259/(dv)+HOWTO:+Raise+Courier-IMAP+Connections"><a href="http://kb.mediatemple.net/questions/259/">http://kb.mediatemple.net/questions/259/</a>(dv)+HOWTO:+Raise+Courier-IMAP+Connections</a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.makeitcomplete.com/2008/11/increase-the-number-of-connection-for-courier-imap-in-plesk/"><a href="http://blog.makeitcomplete.com/2008/11/increase-the-number-of-connection-for-courier-imap-in-plesk/">http://blog.makeitcomplete.com/2008/11/increase-the-number-of-connection-for-courier-imap-in-plesk/</a></a></p>

<p>And 30 seconds later I&rsquo;m connected. I&rsquo;m bound to hit this issue again in the future so I have added this post as a reminder.</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>I changed MAXDAEMONS from 40 to 80 and MAXPERIP from 4 to 40.</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Edmonds Commerce is very pleased to announce the launch of our new <b>link building service</b>.</p>

<p>Any site that wishes to rank well in the search engines for competitive keywords needs to have a link building campaign as an important part of it&rsquo;s SEO strategy. If you are looking to outsource your link building, it is important that you use a company with a deep understanding of SEO. We can offer this to you.</p>

<p>You need to take care choosing your link building service as there are numerous potential pitfalls and mistakes that can be made with a link building campaign and it is all too easy to waste your money on worthless or even counter productive link building strategies.</p>

<p>It is for this reason we have decided to launch our <b>link building service</b>, offering you peace of mind based on the trust that we have built up as a web development company and with the quality and reliability that our development customers already enjoy.</p>

<p>If you are interested in outsourcing your link building to Edmonds Commerce, simply <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/contact-about-link-building-service.html"><b>drop us an email</b></a> or alternatively give us a call on <b>0844 357 0201</b></p>

<p><b>What&rsquo;s Involved?</b></p>

<p>We will ask you for a monthly budget and will work with you to choose some keywords to target. We will then use this budget to build the maximum quantity and quality links possible for you, to the high standards we demand.</p>

<p>What we ask from you as the client is simply a monthly commitment of a set budget to build these links. We strongly believe that a link building campaign should be consistent and permanent rather than a short sharp spike every now and then. For brand new sites there is an argument that an initial burst of link building can be beneficial, primarily to help get the site spidered, but in the longer term a steady stream of new inbound links is much better.</p>

<p>As an initial budget we ask for a minimum of <strong>£100 per month</strong>. Of course you can spend as much as you want, but its more important that is is sustainable so choose a price that is affordable. If that is a bit too much for you, we suggest you look into link building for yourself. Note we really emphasise that you must be able to sustain this price on a monthly basis for at least 6 months. We do not believe or advise in flash in the pan SEO campaigns and strongly suggest implementing a consistent and long term SEO strategy.</p>

<p><b>How Quickly Will it Benefit the Site?</b>
SEO is a long term strategy with a delayed gratification. There are short cuts and possibilities to shoot to the top, but these techniques (often referred to as &lsquo;black hat&rsquo;) are not recommended if you are looking for something reliable and long term. How quickly the new links will start to benefit your site is hard to judge with precision and of course it depends on other factors such as the SEO of the actual site pages themselves and how competitive your particular keywords are. As a general idea though, we would expect to see benefits within a couple of months or so. That said, we are seeing nearly instant benefit to some of our clients who have established sites. It seems they just needed that little extra push for the search engines to really dig into them.</p>

<p><b>Are there Other Thing&rsquo;s My Site Needs for SEO?</b>
Yes link building is only one aspect of a successful SEO campaign. More important than link building is ensuring that the site itself is optimised. This is already something that Edmonds Commerce offers as a service. This is kind of SEO comes under the umbrella term of &lsquo;on site&rsquo; or &lsquo;on page&rsquo; SEO.</p>

<p>Another important factor in SEO is having quality original and keyword rich textual content on your site. Writing search engine friendly text does not require any particular specialist or technical knowledge other than a broad understanding of the principles of SEO and of course a flair for writing helps! We will gladly advise you on how to go about writing optimised content and can give you some pointers on how to improve your content.</p>

<p>If you would be interested in outsourcing your search engine optimised textual content creation do get in touch as we are considering adding this to our portfolio of services at some point in the future.</p>

<p><b>What is Page Rank?</b>
Often you will hear the term page rank (often abbreviated to PR). This refers to Google&rsquo;s Page Rank system. This system gives each page on the internet that Google is aware of a score from 0 to 10. The best score is 10 and 0 is of course the lowest. There are some pages that Google is not even aware of.</p>

<p>Very roughly speaking, Google scores these pages in terms of how many links from other sites are linking to the specific page. If there are lots of other pages linking to this page, the page rank for this page will be higher. Also, PR is passed on. So if your page has lots of links from pages that have a high PR then its likely that your page will have a high PR. Conversely if all of the pages linking to your page have a PR of 0, or worse aren&rsquo;t even known by Google at all, then your PR is likely to be low.</p>

<p><b>Why does PR Matter?</b>
Generally speaking, if there are two pages about the same subject and they are both equal in terms of their &lsquo;on site&rsquo; SEO then the page with the higher page rank will rank higher in the search results than the page with lower page rank. That&rsquo;s it basically, its a factor in determining which pages should be displayed higher in the results. It is by no means the only factor but it is definitely involved.</p>

This is a post that was written a long time ago and is only being kept here for posterity.
You should probably look up more recent blog posts related to the subject you are researching

<p>One of the really cool and powerful features of Magento compared to other more traditional ecommerce platforms is the way that product information is handled. On a traditional system you will likely have one or a small number of tables to store product information. For each element of product information there is a column on these tables. This might be things like price, weight, model code etc etc.</p>

<p>But lets imagine that you sell T shirts. So you decide that you want to add a new column to your system to store the following bits of info:</p>

<p>size
material
male/female</p>

<p>Ok no problem, you add these columns to your table, modify your administration system and front end to display this extra info. Easy enough. You also decide to modify your search page so that people can search by T shirt size, material or mens/womens so your search is much easier to use.</p>

<p>However, lets say you find a new supplier for footwear. You want to add all these new products to your system but you also want to be able to store the extra information related to shoes, for example:</p>

<p>UK Size
European Size
Upper
Sole</p>

<p>Of course you can go ahead and add a bunch more columns to your table and store this info. However, now you have the issue that you need to edit your front end to only display the shoe related info for shoes and only the T shirt related info for T shirts. You can probably figure out a way to handle this, but I&rsquo;m sure you can start to see the problem. This approach doesn&rsquo;t scale well. Lets say instead of 2 main product types you have 200 or even 2000.</p>

<p>In the end what ends up happening is that you only store basic specific information about a product and then all the finer details go into the product description. Thats fine, but its not great. Also you have to lose your nice new search functionality.</p>

<p>Magento deals with this in an entirely different way. Instead of having the traditional spreadsheet like database table relationships (1 row for each product), Magento does things differently and stores 1 item of information per row (over simplified but enough to illustrate my point). This means that there is no limit to how many elements of information can be stored for each product.</p>

<p>Magento Groups these attributes (as it calls them) into attribute sets. An attribute set is simply enough a collection of attributes. There is a default attribute set which you would generally make a copy of and then customise for each kind of product you want to have custom attributes for. So continuing our T shirts and shoes example, you would make a new attribute set called T shirts, based on the Default set, and also one for shoes.</p>

<p>The T shirts attribute set will contain all the standard attributes (such as price, title etc) inherited from the default set, but we can also add in our custom attributes. Same goes for the shoes.</p>

<p>Then when we want to add a new product (lets say a T shirt) we select the T shirts attribute set so that we then have fields to enter information for our custom T shirt attributes.</p>
