<h1>Handle Vast Product Catalogues with Ease</h1>


<br/><p>Many <a href="../../ecommerce/" title="Information Explaining Ecommerce">Ecommerce</a> packages currently available do have some nice product handling systems built in, allowing you to insert and update products one by one. This is fine for occasional work, editing the odd product or adding a couple of new releases. However, if you are thinking of taking on a whole new line or there has recently been a new price list release, the task of updating products one by one is daunting at best and may prove to be impossible.</p><h2>Bulk Catalogue Handling</h2><p>Those with a bit more experience in the <a href="../../ecommerce/" title="Information Explaining Ecommerce">Ecommerce</a> field will probably be familiar with handling product catalogues in bulk, using excel or similar to deal with the entire catalogue as a spread sheet and then reuploading to achieve bulk updates. Likewise with image processing, the more advanced <a href="../../ecommerce/" title="Information Explaining Ecommerce">Ecommerce</a> <a href="../../marketing/business/" title="Information Explaining Business">Business</a>es will use batch processing in a program like Photoshop to manipulate entire folders of images. This is a great way of working and if you do not already have this facility, we can help you build it into your systems and train you up on using them to achieve greater efficency.</p><h2>Full Product Automation</h2><p>Bulk products tools are an excellent way to achieve greater efficiency and are a must have facility for any serious <a href="../../ecommerce/" title="Information Explaining Ecommerce">Ecommerce</a> <a href="../../marketing/business/" title="Information Explaining Business">Business</a>. However, the possibilities do not end there. Depending on where you source your product information from, it is entirely possible to build a tool which will keep your product catalogue completely up to date, with the latest description, trade price information and images without you having to do more than click a few buttons.</p><h2>How Does it Work</h2><p>Without going into excessive details, suffice to say that most things that you (or your staff) could do on a computer, a small program can be written to do the same task at computer speeds and with computer accuracy. Furthermore, this can be done out of hours, overnight and as often as you wish!</p>

<h2>Effective Web Sites, by Design</h2>


<p>Web design is the process of building the graphical and layout aspects of your web site. The ideal web design does not shout out, it sits in the background, subtly but confidently encouraging the visitor to feel confident, to read your key content and to proceed through your web site to your desired goal. This may be purchasing a product, it may be simply getting in touch with you to discuss your services, but whatever the goal of your web site - the design should smooth the way for your visitor and funnel them towards the goal.</p>


<h2>Search Engine Friendliness</h2>


<p>One of the biggest benefits of hiring Edmonds Commerce to design your web site is that not only will you get a professional web design, but your web design will also be designed with maximum search engine friendliness in mind.This means that unlike many web designs, when the search engines discover your web pages, they will easily be able to figure out what the page is about and will therefore give it a good ranking for those terms. Of course there are many other aspects to achieving good search engine results, but without using a search engine friendly web design you will find it very difficult to get the results you desire.</p>


<h2>Fast Loading Web Design</h2>


<p>Page load times are very important for keeping your visitors happy and therefore on your site. If a page is slow to load, your visitors will be tempted to hit the back key and try another web site instead. There are many factors that can contribute to slow loading web sites, but an overly graphical web design can be a major factor. Big graphics can look really nice, but there is a definite tradeoff in terms of page load times as it takes a relatively long time to download lots of large image files.This can be made even worse if the web design does not function without the images. If for example the page is not readable until all of the images are downloaded, then your vistors are forced to wait for each page to completely download before they can continue navigating through your site to find the page that they are looking for.  Edmonds Commerce will always try to use the absolute minimum of graphics, and will always take steps to make the filesizes of the graphics used as small as possible. This can make a huge difference to the speed with which your web pages load for your visitors. All this without compromising on the professional look and feel of your web site.</p>


<h2>Standard Compliant Code</h2>


<p>There are two key ways that a web browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox can interperet a web page. The easiest is when a page is written in error free code. There are a set of rules or standards that are set out for web design. It is perfectly possible to create a web design that does not conform to these rules, but if your design does not conform then the web browser has to do a lot more work to figure out exactly how to layout all of your web site. This extra work for the web browser means slower loading pages for your visitors - something that you really want to avoid. Edmonds Commerce will always stick to standards compliant code as much as your chosen content allows.</p>


<h2>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</h2>


<p>Modern web design aims to separate form and function into separate files of code. Your main web page contains all of the content and then the styling and layout is controlled by a separate file called a stylesheet. This method of web design is faster for the visitors as their machine will access the stylesheet once and will then be able to reuse it for each subsequent page - possibly halving the amount of text needing to be downloaded. Furthermore, using external stylesheets gives you much greater control over the design of your web site - allowing you to make alterations across your entire web site whilst only having to edit one file.Many web designers are still waking up to the possiblities of CSS, but Edmonds Commerce will always use standards compliant external stylesheets to give your site the maximum benefit of the latest web design best practices.</p>

<h1>Ecommerce Developers</h1>


<h2>Custom Magento Development</h2>


<p>Magento is in our opinion the best e-commerce platform available at the moment, paid for or not. The range of features that are bundled with Magento as standard are staggering. However as there are so many different kinds of business with such a variety of requirements, even Magento can not satisfy everyone&#8217;s specific requirements.</p>


<p> If Magento doesn&#8217;t do something as standard, there is a good chance that you will be able to find a Magento extension that will offer the functionality you need. We will happily advise you on this and will always try to meet your requirements in the most cost effective way by utilising existing extensions wherever possible. In those circumstances though where there is not a currently available extension that meets the requirements, we are more than happy to create a custom module for you to make Magento work exactly the way that you want.
</p>


<p>Edmonds Commerce is ready to help you with your web development needs. No matter if you are looking for a simple customisation of your existing web systems or if you are looking for a complete overhaul or entirely new system, we are ready to help you get the online system that you want and for the right price.</p>


<h2>Modern Web Development</h2>


<p>The web has become much more than online paper. Interactive content and database driven web sites are now the norm. The technology allows us to handle huge web sites filled with content and somehow magically keep it all up to date and hold it all together. If you want to achieve more with less expenditure of effort and capital then speak to us about ways to achieve this. Don&#8217;t just work hard: work smart.</p>


<p> <h2>Microsoft or Not?</h2><p>Edmonds Commerce do not recommend using Microsoft products to run a web site. There are many reasons for this including cost, ease of use, flexibility, security, reliability and performance. All of the web development technology that Edmonds Commerce recommends is designed to run on the linux operating system. Instead Edmonds Commerce recommends using the LAMP stack . The LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, <a href="mysql/" title="Information Explaining MySQL">MySQL</a> and <a href="php/" title="Information Explaining PHP">PHP</a>) is one of the most popular web server platforms for modern dynamic web sites today and for good reason.</p><h2>Linux Server Operating System</h2> Whilst linux is not a very popular desktop operating system, it is an incredibly popular server operating system. You may be concerned that as you are only familiar with Microsoft products, you should stick to Microsoft for your server platform. This is not a sound basis on which to make the decision as unlike a desktop operating system such as Windows, you will very rarely, if ever,  interact with your server operating system. Essentially a server is set up for you and apart from maintainence which will be carried out by your hosting provider will not need to be interacted with. insteas all you will do is upload the occasional files using FTP and use the online applications that are installed on your server. In this sense you will not notice any difference between any server operating system. <h2>Apache</h2><p>Apache is <a href="http://www.securityspace.com/s_survey/data/200712/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">by far the most popular</a> HTTP system used on web servers today. It is hugely configurable and powerful with vast resources and support allowing you to make it work in exactly the way you want. Some of the great features that you will use in Apache are virtual domains and URL rewriting. Virtual domains allow you to host as many individual domain names and web sites on your server as you wish. You can manage all of these sites on one server which makes life very easy and saves a lot of money on hosting. URL rewriting is a very powerful and useful system allowing you to use more friendly urls such as www.mysite.com/garden-tools/spade.123.html for a product page of a spade instead of www.mysite.com/product_page.php?category=1234&amp;product=123. This makes things nicer for your users and also helps you in your <a href="../development/seo" title="Information Explaining SEO">SEO</a> efforts.</p> <h2>PHP and MySQL</h2><p>PHP is a programming language that has been in development for well over a decade and is now up to version 5. It is very powerful and yet can be incredibly simple to use. <a href="php/" title="Information Explaining PHP">PHP</a> is a scripting language which means that it can be used to make simple programmes and add logic to a <a href="../development/websites" title="Information Explaining Website">Website</a>. This allows us to create rich, interactive and dynamic web sites with ease. <a href="mysql/" title="Information Explaining MySQL">MySQL</a> is one of the most popular open source implementations of the SQL database system. It is also highly developed and is currently on version 5 also. <a href="mysql/" title="Information Explaining MySQL">MySQL</a> allows us to retrieve specific information relating to particular quieries at lighting speed. It is a relational database which means that we can have multiple tables and pull up data according to multiple conditions across multiple tables. Combining <a href="php/" title="Information Explaining PHP">PHP</a> and <a href="mysql/" title="Information Explaining MySQL">MySQL</a> give us almost unlimited possiblities for creating rich applications online.</p></p>

<p>If you use the Magento event / observer system for extending Magento (if you don&rsquo;t you should) then you will find this little script handy for parsing out all of the events in the latest (eg Magento 1.4) version of Magento.</p>

<p>This is a Linux shell script so either use it on your server or if you run a decent desktop OS you should be able to run it on your desktop.</p>

<p>There are two parameters you need to define.</p>

<p>If you have any issues with the default Flash based image uploader for the Magento admin, check out this extension which replaces it with a much slicker, faster and less &ndash; well <i>flash</i> &ndash; image uploader.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/extension/1756/no-flash-uploader"><a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/extension/1756/no-flash-uploader">http://www.magentocommerce.com/extension/1756/no-flash-uploader</a></a></p>

<p>nice :)</p>
