<p>If you use Git a lot, you probably want to run the latest version. Scroll down for some reasons why.</p>

<p>The standard repository version for Ubuntu is 1.7.1, the current latest is 1.7.5 and there are some significant differences.</p>

<h2>How to Upgrade Git</h2>


<p>To get 1.7.5 on Ubuntu without too much messing about you can do the following:</p>

<h3>1. Set up this PPA:</h3>


<figure class='code panel panel-default'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pdoes/ppa/ubuntu
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<h3>2. Now run an aptitude update and upgrade git</h3>


<figure class='code panel panel-default'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>sudo apt-get update
</span><span class='line'>sudo aptitude upgrade git
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<h3>3. Now check your git version</h3>


<figure class='code panel panel-default'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>git --version
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<h3>Full Script for the lazy</h3>


<figure class='code panel panel-default'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pdoes/ppa/ubuntu && sudo apt-get update && sudo aptitude upgrade && git --version
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<h2>Why Upgrade Git?</h2>


<p>We have been having lots of merge hassles casued purely by white space changes. Apparently with 1.7.4 new recursive merge strategies came into play that should alleviate this pain and make merging a lot less hassle.</p>

<h3>Merge Ignore Whitespace</h3>


<figure class='code panel panel-default'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>git merge -s recursive -Xignore-space-change $BRANCH_NAME
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Less hassle equals more productive and happier developers :)</p>

<p>Running PHP on the command line, via cron etc there are a few common problems you can hit and from experience this my recommendations to avoid them.</p>

<p>It seems that (on CentOS at least) PHP does not display errors by default on the command line. You will want it to I assume so you can understand what has gone wrong with the cron task etc.</p>

<p>You can use php.ini files but its not always easy to know exactly which ini file is going to to be used. If certain settings are required, use the -d flag to set specific ini directives directly when you run PHP.</p>

<p>I have just had an issue where a script was running out of memory but no error message was displayed, despite the fact that display errors was turned on. However digging around showed that memory usage was hitting the limit and the script died silently. Increasing the memory limit fixed it.</p>

<p>Here is my standard PHP CLI runner:</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>/usr/bin/php -d display_errors -d memory_limit=512M /path/to/php/file.php
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>It used to be Tabberwocky but that&rsquo;s died with FF4</p>

<p>I now recommend <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search/?q=tab+mix+plus&cat=all&x=0&y=0">Tab Mix Plus</a> which lets you achieve the holy grail, duplicate tabs!</p>

<p>Who would have though it was so hard.</p>

<p>Maybe FF5 will get some chrome like tab controls but for now this extension does a fair bit</p>

<p>If you are looking for a light weight, fast, PHP based yet fully featured issue tracking system, <a href="http://elastik.sourceforge.net/">Elastik</a> is a great choice. Here is a quick start guide for it&rsquo;s usage.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>


<p>When working on any type of development project be it a design, programming even construction problems within the project will almost certainly arise. Keeping track of the problems that people have brought to attention can be hard to do effectively. Issues might be raised by email, IM or in person. Keeping track of the issues that have been raised can be a real problem if you don&rsquo;t keep on top of it. Even on a single person project, it&rsquo;s so easy to forget that some one pointed out a small problem. Using email and noting systems to track what issues have been raised can work for a small project but will quickly become difficult to work with one there is more than a single person on the project, such system of working will also fall apart if the number of current issues becomes large. Using a system designed to rectify the issue really is a boon. It not only allows each issue and it&rsquo;s status to be tracked, but also standardises the method of communication so that every one knows where to look to see what is happening with an issue. Ultimately, the best benefit of using a tracking system is not losing/forgetting about any issues that have be raised.
Elastik’s intended use is for multi-client multi-project purposes. That is to say Elastik can have many clients using it, each client having multiple projects.</p>

<h3>Creating Account and Account Permissons</h3>


<p>Account creation of elastic is done via email on a invitation only basis. Only System, Project or Client Administrators can invite additional users. Elastik has quite granular user permissions. To start with there are three types of users Administrator, Client users/administrators and Project users/administrators. In terms of access levels Project users/administrator are the ‘lowest’ permission’ed user as they only have access to a single project. Client users/administrators have access to all the projects that a client has and system administrators have global access. On top of these levels of access, Client users can also be administrators of the client and the same applies to project users. Elastik also has granular per-project and per-client permissions settings available. In summary, if you want to tightly control access to the tracking system, you can do it in great detail.</p>

<h3>Setting up a client project</h3>


<p>Elastik uses the concept that each project belongs to a client. Even if you are making an application for your self, there is still a client involved (you!). So before you can create a project you need to create a client. This is a way of grouping projects together as well as defining a client owner. When creating a client you are required to supply an email address. The person who owns this address will be given client level access and will have client access permissions, and there for access to all project that belong to that client. Client administrators can change settings related to the client and all the projects that belong to that client. If you do not wish to setup any client level access you can enter a existing system administrator’s email address and then add a new user to the client/project later. All this also applies when creating a new project.</p>

<h3>Managing Issues</h3>


<p>Tickets is what issue tracking is all about. Ultimately working with tickets can be as straight forward as you like or as complex. Using the default ticket categories and schema will be enough for most situations and will even be workable even if they are not. However, Elastik allows you to create much more complex ticket structure which should make it flexible enough for use with any project.</p>

<h3>Customising Tickets</h3>


<p>The default ticket structure is that a ticket can either be a new feature request or a problem within already existing functionality. You can either expand or shrink this as necessary on a per client or project basis.</p>

<p>The default ticket schema is that a ticket can either be “Open” or “Closed”. You can customise this to have as many different ticket status as you like. Elastik also has the idea that it should be logically impossible to go one ticket status to a particular other one. For example, it would not logically make sense for a ticket to be able to transition from “Closed” to “New Ticket” as the ticket already exists so it is not a new ticket at all. In this example you would probably want to change to “Re-opened ticket”. Elastik allows you to specify that “New Ticket” is the default status of a new ticket and that it impossible for a ticket’s status to be “New Ticket” after is has already been changed, transitions can be defined to be quite complex.</p>

<h3>Extensions</h3>


<p>Elastik has a modular design and comes pre-packaged with a number of modules all of which are disabled by default, presumably because some people may simply not want them. Below are two that web developers who often spend allot of time communicating with clients may find particularly useful.</p>

<h4>E-Mail Summaries</h4>


<p>By default Elastik only uses email for setting up accounts and nothing else. The email summaries module will send emails to individuals periodically informing them of changes made on a project or client. This does require a cron/scheduled task be setup on a computer to function however. This is particularly useful to keep clients up to date with changes to issues and also keep you up to date on issues the client is raising.
One minor draw back is that by default it will only email changes to tickets to people who are watching the ticket. However, you can enable it to send every one on a project all updates whether they are watching it or not in the projects configuration.</p>

<h4>File Attachments</h4>


<p>The file attachments extensions allows files to be uploaded to the hosting server and attached (associated) with a ticket. Files are attached after ticket creation which does reduce the steamlined-iness of the process, but you can attach more than one file to a ticket.
The one thing to watch out for when using this extension is that it defaults to not allowing any uploads and you have to explicitly define what file extension types can be uploaded on a per-client or per-project basis. You will most likely want to enable all image formats so client can upload screen shots of the issue.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>


<p>If you are having any amount of trouble communicating and keeping track of issues for any type of project, using Elastik is definitely a good way to solve this.
Elastik is fast, customisable, flexible, functionally complete despite been at version 0.4.1. No major draw backs despite been incomplete. Personally I would like to see it keep the light weight approach so that it doesn’t matter how old/rubbish a clients computer might be and they are using IE6 it will still be fast. It will also mean that if your server is over loaded, it will still run fast. Of course, if it doesn&rsquo;t do what you want out of the box, it is PHP based and open source, you can either write a new module for it or fork it and start hacking at the code.</p>

<p>If you want to offer a csv feed and want the results to be on demand and like the idea of avoiding messing about righting to files on the server etc, you might like this little manuever.</p>

<p>You will notice I&rsquo;m using a non standard db_query function, just assume that this does all the sensible stuff it should.</p>

<p>Also the query needs to be modified to suit.</p>

<p>The trick is writing to PHP&rsquo;s built in php://output stream which is basically just STDOUT.</p>

<p>Note the headers which are specifically required to get IE to accept the file as a download. Other browsers will accept less headers but will also work fine with these.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>If you have just created your Magento extension but you are now wondering how you can successfully publish it to the community then this article is for you!!</p>

<p>Magento-Connect is an official &ldquo;repository&rdquo; for all Magento extensions and a better place where developers can add custom extensions or plugins for community or commercial use.</p>

<p>However, publishing or registering your extension on Magento Connect can sometimes be a pain especially if it is your first ever time to do so. Publishing your extension incorrectly can easily result to unexpected results notably upgrading someone&rsquo;s entire site</p>

<p>I will definitely recommend packaging your extension on Magento 1.5.x.x as the packaging tool there seems to be well improved compared to the previous versions.</p>

<p>Lets get things started:</p>

<p>Login to admin and go to System &ndash;> Magento Connect &ndash;> Package Extensions</p>

<p>Once there, please follow the following steps.</p>

<h2>Package Info:</h2>


<p>Here is where you will need to provide the details of your extension.
<img src="/assets/Packaging_info-300x296.png"></p>

<p><b>The supported release works like this.</b></p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><li>If you want your extension to only work on Magento version 1.5.x.x and above (Select 1.5.0.0 &amp; later)</li></p>

<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;If you want to support previous versions as well you will need to select Pre-1.5.0.0 (Magento will automatically create the URL for version 2.0 of the Magento Connect. This will effectively make your extension available for later versions as well.)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Name must be the same as the name of your extension.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;License and License URI are the same for most part, unless you want to use a different license.&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></ul></p>

<h2>Release</h2>


<p>Specify your extension release details. Straight forward matters.
<img src="/assets/Screenshot-300x231.png"></p>

<p><b>Release Version is the version of your extension.</b></p>

<h2>Authors</h2>


<p>Here you will need to list the author names of the extension.
<img src="/assets/Screenshot-1-300x28.png"></p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The user field, MUST be the same as the name on your Magento Account. This is NOT your screen name, it is the user name as found in My Account on your Magento account.</p>

<h2>Dependencies:</h2>


<p>Most likely you will only need to specify the PHP versions dependencies. However, if your extension depends on other extensions/packages or other libraries, here is the place for your to specify.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Dependence-300x74.png"></p>

<h2>Contents</h2>


<p>Here is the place you tell Extension packager where the extension files are. Below I specified the relative paths to the target field.
<img src="/assets/Screenshot-2-300x36.png"></p>

<p>The path field, is where you will enter the path to the directory of files relative to the Target. The relative folders to the targets are</p>

<p>Magento Local module file:  is app/code/local/
Magento Community module file:  is app/code/community/
Magento Global Configuration:  is app/etc/
Magento Core team module file:  is app/code/core/
Magento User Interface (layouts, templates):  is app/design/
Magento PHP Library file:  is lib/
Magento Locale language file:  is app/locale/
Magento Media library: is media/
Magento Theme Skin (Images, CSS, JS):  is skin/
Magento Other web accessible file:  is /
Magento PHPUnit test: is tests/
Magento other: is /</p>

<p>You are now ready to package your extension. Press the Save Data and Create Package button at top right of the page.</p>

<p>Depending on the supported release choice you have made in the first step, your extension files will be in the following location
<b>Release 1.5.0.0 &amp; later: var/connect</p>

<p>Release Pre-1.5.0.0 : var/pear</b></p>

<h2>Possible Gotchas / Errors</h2>


<p><b>Release file already exists:</b>
If you get this error: Simply increase the version of the package, re-save the extension and upload it again.</p>

<p><b>Release refered to unknown or non-existent extension </b>
The package name in package info section MUST be the same as the name of your package.</p>

<p>I hope you find this article helpfully.</p>

<p>If you have any question or feedback please feel free to drop a comment with your own experience.</p>

<p>Bash provides many powerful functions but how can you use these easily?</p>

<p>If you spend any time using the command line, either to manage a server or on the desktop, you have to quickly become proficient with bash. You will also find the you carry out many of the same tasks time after time.</p>

<p>This can quickly become tiresome and error prone, particularly if you are piping several commands together. However, bash provides several ways to make your life easier.</p>

<h3>Aliases</h3>


<p>If you are always going to be using the same flags with a command, you can ensure that they are called by default by using an alias.</p>

<p>An alias is a shorthand that bash uses in order to fire commands. Several are included as standard with Ubuntu (and other distros) and are stored in your .bashrc file. You can edit these and add your own as the need occurs.</p>

<p>An example of this is that I prefer the human readable file sizes when using ls. You can turn these on using the -h flag, but you have to include this every time you run the command. To make things easier I changed the alias for ll (long list) to read as follows</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>alias ll="ls -ahlF"
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This way I don&rsquo;t need to remember to put the flag in.</p>

<p>As you build up more of these commands, it makes sense to store them in a separate file so you can easily find and edit them. You can place all of you aliases in a file called .bash_aliases and they will be available for use.</p>

<h3>Scripts</h3>


<p>Aliases are fine for quickly calling simple commands, but many times you will need to carry out more complex tasks. In order to do this, you can make a script, and then call that.</p>

<p>By placing everything into a script, you benefit from being able to carry out more complicated functions, and the easy of calling it from a single command.</p>

<p>An example of this would be if you wanted to compare two branches in git, and see all of the files that had been created or modified, but not the files that had been deleted. You create a file called git_get_changed_files and put the following in</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>#!/bin/bash
</span><span class='line'>local ORIGINAL CHANGED FILES 
</span><span class='line'>ORIGINAL="$1"
</span><span class='line'>CHANGED="$2"
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    FILES=$(git diff --name-status $ORIGINAL..$CHANGED public/ | awk '{print $1"@@@@@"$2}')
</span><span class='line'>    for FILE in $FILES
</span><span class='line'>    do
</span><span class='line'>            echo "$FILE" | awk -F "@@@@@" '{ i=""; if ($1 != "D") print $2}'
</span><span class='line'>    done
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you place this in your home/bin folder you will then be able to run  git_get_changed_files like a normal command.</p>

<h3>A Global Function Library</h3>


<p>You can expand on this by creating a global library of functions. This works by putting all of the functions into a folder, where each file is a namespace for different functions.</p>

<p>This can be achieved by creating a script that will source of all of the files in a folder, like so:</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>#!/bin/bash
</span><span class='line'>for f in $(ls /path/to/folder/); 
</span><span class='line'>    do source /path/to/folder/$f; 
</span><span class='line'>done
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Call this script func and place it in your home/bin folder. Then you put a script in the folder referenced in the file and use the following structure.</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
<span class='line-number'>19</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>function parse.(){ # auto complete helper, second argument is a grep against the function list     
</span><span class='line'>    if [[ '' == "$@" ]]
</span><span class='line'>    then
</span><span class='line'>        echo "Parse Namespaced Functions List"
</span><span class='line'>        cat $BASH_SOURCE | grep "^function[^(]" | awk '{j=" USAGE:"; for (i=5; i&lt;=NF; i++) j=j" "$i; print $2" "j}'
</span><span class='line'>    else
</span><span class='line'>        echo "Parse Functions Matching: $@"
</span><span class='line'>        cat $BASH_SOURCE | grep "^function[^(]" | awk '{j=" USAGE:"; for (i=5; i&lt;=NF; i++) j=j" "$i; print $2" "j}' | grep $@
</span><span class='line'>    fi
</span><span class='line'>}
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>function parse.access_log_top_ten_code() { # Show the top ten code from access_log: useage ...code $FILE $CODE
</span><span class='line'>  FILE=$1
</span><span class='line'>  CODE=$2
</span><span class='line'>  echo "Count the top ten $CODE'd pages"
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  cat $FILE | awk '{ i=($9=="$CODE" ) ? $7 : ""; print i; }' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 11 | head -n 10
</span><span class='line'>}
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In this folder a namespace of parse is created. Running</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>func parse. 
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Will list all of the function in the file. Running func parse. log will list all of the function that contain log in the function name or description. When the files are listed, the function name will be displayed with the comment along side it.</p>

<p>As the func command sources all of the different files, you are able to makes use of the functions across different namespaces. This means that you can create a file that will format output and then use that in with your git functions.</p>

<p>I hope that you are able to make use of this idea, and build your own library of functions. Anything that you thing would be useful to add to the library, please mention below.</p>

<p>If you have a secondary hard drive that you have to manually mount in Ubuntu/Linux everytime you boot up and you are not too comfortable with the syntax for fstab, this is a possible easy shortcut for you.</p>

<p>You can view the currently mounted partitions by looking at mtap</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>cat /etc/mtab
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you do this after you have mounted the drive, you can see the full mount command that has been used, eg</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>/dev/sdc1 /media/BigDrive ext4 rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=udisks 0 0
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can copy that line and paste it into your fstab and from then on when you boot up the drive will be mounted automatically.</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>sudo gedit /etc/fstab
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I have no idea what all that stuff means and to be honest I don&rsquo;t care I just want to use my hard drive.</p>

<p>ALWAYS back up your fstab before making changes!</p>

<p>Hope that helps ;)</p>
