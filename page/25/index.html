            The function below is one that we have used a few times to allow certain &ldquo;admin only&rdquo; assets to be accessed or visible on the front end of a website. The theory is that the htaccess file in the admin folder will be kept up to date and can therefore be used as the authoritative list of IP addresses that are allowed to access admin assets. This function is simple enough and should be useful anywhere that you use htaccess to protect a certain folder and would like to implement the same white list rules in other places without having to maintain a duplicate list of authorised IP addresses.

            Mobile internet usage is perhaps one of the defining revolutions of this decade. People love how quick and easy it is to quickly look up something on their mobile that they carry around 24/7. Signs of mobile usage are now all around us. People scroll through websites on tablets, smartphones, notebooks and other web-enabled mobile devices to pass their time. According to the BBC, almost 50% of people have used the internet whilst away from their computer in a survey last year.

            What EC2 is and how it differs from standard hosting Aside from shared hosting, Virtual Private Servers and Dedicated Servers, another form is cloud hosting. EC2 is Amazon&rsquo;s answer to this EC2 allows you to run &ldquo;instances&rdquo; which are prebuilt images which from your perspective is just like a virtual machine. The difference being that it&rsquo;s in no way fixed to a physical machine, or even datacentre. Using Magento with EC2 Obviously there are prebuilt images for various platforms (Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian etc) and Magento can be installed on these as with any server.

            As you might be aware, the UK PHP Conference was held in London last weekend. Having been the lucky winner of a ticket from PHP NW I went along. The Venue The conference was held in The Brewery in London city centre, a well suited conference centre with a variety of different conference rooms. An old Whitbread brewery, it was modern and practical while still maintaining enough of its history to keep its character.

            Edmonds Commerce employs a team of specialist PHP web developers who are all Zend Certified Engineers. This is a highly respected PHP qualification that ensures the highest standards of PHP development expertise. By achieving this certification we ensure that our developers have the kind of well rounded and deep understanding of the PHP language that can be utilised to achieve the highest quality production. All of the e-commerce platforms, such as Magento and OpenCart are written in PHP and so the first thing to be sure of when you have a developer working on your projects is that they are very skilled in PHP itself as well as having an expert knowledge of the platform.
