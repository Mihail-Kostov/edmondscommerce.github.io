<h1>Do More, Faster</h1>


<br/><p>Edmonds Commerce would love to help you get the best out of your current hosting platform by helping you to ensure that your software is as fast and efficient as possible. By trimming away unneccesary processes and ensuring that things are being done in the most efficient way, we can shave seconds off page load times and vastly improve the experience to your web site visitors. Get in touch today to see what we can do for you.</p><h2>Hitting the Bottleneck</h2><p>Any web master would be happy to have more and more visitors to their web site. However you can reach a point where the number of visits to your web site is becoming more than your web site can handle. This leaves you with two real options:<ul class='performance'><li><b>1. Get a Faster Host</b></li></ul>Increasing the specification of your hosting platform is often necessary if your site starts to get more visitors than it can really handle. However this is a complicated and often costly thing to do to a live web site.<ul class='performance'><li><b>2. Improve the Performance of your Software</b></li></ul>Often there are great gains to be had by simply giving your code an overhaul to trim away unnecessary processes and ensure that logical tasks are being done in the most efficient way. The performance gains can be astounding!</p><h2>Efficient Database Queries</h2><p>On modern database driven dynamic web sites, the usual culprit for slow load times is the database queries being performed to grab the information that will be displayed on the page. Badly formed database queries can quickly add up and pile on the waiting time for your page to load.</p>

<h1>Powerful Packages Without Cost</h1>


<br/><p>Edmonds Commerce are happy to help you to sort the wheat from the chaff and find the best combination of free and paid for software to give your company the power it needs at the minimum cost. The intelligent use of open source software has the potential to both save your organisation large sums of money on licensing fees, but also empowers your workforce with some of the most cutting edge software available today. <a href="../../contact-us/">Get in touch today</a> if you would like to discuss the tremendous opportunities of open source software and how they relate to you.</p><h2>The Cutting Edge</h2><p>  Thanks to the way that open source software is developed, it is much faster moving that some commercial software, with bug fixes and patches being released very quickly. Likewise new features and improvements are constantly being released meaning that open source software is not only a great option for now, but will remain to be in the future - which protects your investment into it.</p><h2>Open Source Web Technology</h2><p>If there is one area of computing that is undoubtably dominated by open source software then that is the realm of the web server. The role of a web server is relatively simple, our main requirements being that it is as fast as possible and stays running for as long as possible. Open source software, most usually a Linux operating system using Apache, fits this bill perfectly and enjoys the progressive development and excellent features of modern open source software.</p>

<h2>MySQL Summary</h2>


<p><a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a> is the most popular database engine in use on the web. It is entirely open source and is released under the GNU General Public License.</p>

<p>MySQL is what is called a relational database management system (RDBMS). This means that it contains one or more tables and the tables can have relationships set up between them. This is what makes a database such as MySQL so much more powerful than other data structures such as flat files or spreadsheets.</p>

<p>As part of the LAMP stack, MySQL is the default database engine powering a large portion of the web.</p>

<h2>MySQL Performance Optimisation</h2>


<p>With today&rsquo;s dynamic web sites, it is often the database side of things that is working the hardest to handle things like displaying pages, search results and allowing customers to place orders. Like many complex and powerful pieces of software, MySQL can be quite sensitive to proper configuration and optimsation. If your site is running slowly the culprit may well be a badly written database query or an under optimised MySQL configuration.</p>

<p>Edmonds Commerce can analyse your pages and the database queries powering them and can then make code or configuration changes that can have dramatic beneficial effects on your page load time and general server load.</p>

<h2>Enterprise MySQL</h2>


<p>For larger and busier web sites it is possible to use multiple MySQL servers as a group to give greater performance, reliability and resilience. The usual configuration is to have one master database which accepts updates and then a few slave databases that are read only and handle the bulk of the work for general page display.</p>

<p>If even more performance is required then more advanced clustering strategies can be employed such as partitioning and sharding.</p>

<p>If this kind of functionality is required then Enterprise customers might consider moving away from the open source MySQL database and into one of the commercial offerings.</p>

<h2>MySQL Variants and Forks</h2>


<p>Along with pure MySQL there are now a couple of popular MySQL variants that are based and compatible with MySQL but feature further optimisations and features. The most popular of these is the <a href="http://www.percona.com/software" target="_blank">Percona</a> and <a href="https://mariadb.org/" target="_blank">MariaDB</a>. These are compatible with MySQL and can be dropped in place of MySQL with little effort and can give a good performance boost.</p>

<h1>PHP Hypertext Preprocessor</h1>


<br/>Edmonds Commerce are ready to help you with your PHP projects, no matter if you want a simple customisation to your existing platform or if you are looking to implement an entirely new solution. <a href="../../contact-us/">Contact us today</a> to see how you can use our PHP development services.</p>




<h2>Zend Certified Developers</h2>


<p>The company behind PHP is <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/" target="_blank">Zend</a>. They have a well established certification program whereby developers can sit an exam to verify their skills as a PHP developer. The exam covers a broad and challenging range of topics and it is fair to say that any PHP developer that has sat the exam has a good broad knowledge of PHP and its many attributes and abilities. On passing the exam the developer becomes a <a href="http://www.zend.com/services/certification/php-5-certification/" target="_blank">Zend Certified Engineer</a>, often abreviated to ZCE.</p>

<p>All of the developers at Edmonds Commerce are Zend Certified or if they have joined recently they might be sitting it soon. In general we expect developers to have passed the exam within three months of joining our team if they were not already certified.</p>

<h2>LAMP Stack</h2>


<p>One of the four key components of the LAMP Stack, PHP is one of the most popular programming languages in use in web development today. It has been around since the early nineties and has always been focussed on being the tool of choice to create dynamic web sites. Edmonds Commerce have years of experience in PHP and have used to create all kinds of online system, both customer facing and back end.</p>

<h2>Free Software, Blue Chip</h2>


<p>A common mistake made by those not too familiar with web technologies is to expect that you will &ldquo;get what you pay for&rdquo;, meaning that any thing that is without cost must be an inferior option. Whilst PHP is free, this is due to the way it has been developed in an open source format. Like many other open source and free web technologies the absolute opposite is true, the best option is open source and therefore without cost. If you need convincing that PHP is a suitable system for creating serious web sites, how about this for a line up: Yahoo, Facebook, Youtube to name but a few.</p>

<h2>Open Source Packages</h2>


<p>Being such a well developed and supported programming language, it is perhaps unsurprising to see that there are a great many highly developed and functional PHP based open source platforms already in existence which with a bit of modification can be used to set up the most usual forms of web sites with very little outlay compared to completely bespoke programming. PHP and <a href="../mysql/" title="Information Explaining MySQL">MySQL</a> are essential components for running popular content management systems such as Joomla!, WordPress and Drupal. Wikipedia runs on MediaWiki software, which is written in PHP and uses a <a href="../mysql/" title="Information Explaining MySQL">MySQL</a> database. In e-commerce we have one of the most powerful open source PHP applications of all time &ndash; <a href="/platforms/magento">Magento</a>.</p>

<h1>Your Business Information, Instantly</h1>


<br/><p>By building your <a href="../../marketing/business/" title="Information Explaining Business">Business</a> around a robust online <a href="../../marketing/business/" title="Information Explaining Business">Business</a> platform you enable the possiblity to gather together all of the pertinent information that you need. This information is up to the minute accurate and can be displayed in any way that you like to give you a management overview of the current state of play.</p><h2>Effective Management Decisions</h2><p>Without the right information at the right time, how can you expect yourself or your staff to make the right decisions? The answer of course is that you can not, at least not all of the time. An effective management information system will help you and your staff see what needs to be done and to prioritise their workload.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>The right decision. How much is that worth? It could be that by making the right decisions and acting upon information your <a href="../../marketing/business/" title="Information Explaining Business">Business</a> can respond with agility to the challenges that it faces. This could manifest in a lower number of customers cancelling orders. It could mean better accounting systems that maximise settlement discounts. It could mean higher levels of customer satisfaction which engender profitable repeat purchases. The liklihood is that every aspect of your <a href="../../marketing/business/" title="Information Explaining Business">Business</a> will benefit from an effective management information system. Ultimately that means more profit for you.</p>

<h1>Staff Clocking and Holidays Systems</h1>


<br/><p>Your staff are likely to be one of the biggest costs to your <a href="../../marketing/business/" title="Information Explaining Business">Business</a> and it is imperative that you ensure you are getting the best from your staff. There are many aspects to this challenge and unfortunately we can not help you on all fronts. However what we can offer are clear and accurate systems for monitoring how many hours your staff are working and also automate administration of paid holidays etc.</p><h2>Hours and Pay</h2><p>A subsidiary of Edmonds Commerce, <a href="http://www.hours-and-pay.co.uk">hours-and-pay.co.uk</a> is an <a href="http://www.hours-and-pay.co.uk">online timesheet</a> system that allows your staff to clock on and off at the click of a mouse. This powerfully simple system encourages staff to only be clocked on when working. Combined with a move away from salary and onto hourly pay, it also offers carrot motivation with accurate tracking of hours worked in the month. This encourages staff to ensure that they are putting in the right amount of working hours to get the wage they are used to.</p><h2>Complete Control</h2><p>As the hours-and-pay.co.uk <a href="http://www.hours-and-pay.co.uk">online timesheet</a> system is entirely bespoke, we can customise it to your particular specifications including whatever special rules or requirements you need to handle the staff in your <a href="../../marketing/business/" title="Information Explaining Business">Business</a>. Furthermore, an easy to use online administration system makes payday gross wage calculations a breeze and easily lets you monitor the activities of all your staff from one location.</p><h2>Cost Effectiveness</h2><p>We have personally seen the huge impact on productivity and motivation in staff that this system brings. Much better and a lot cheaper than a real paper based clocking system and with potentially huge savings on your wage bill, we stand by this system as a &#8220;must have&#8221; for the small to medium sized enterprise.</p>

<h1>Reinvented Inventory Management</h1>


<br/><p>A <a href="../../marketing/business/" title="Information Explaining Business">Business</a> needs to know what it has in stock so that stock levels can be maintained and customers can have an idea of turnaround time when placing an order. An inventory management system that relies extensively on human input is highly liable to be inaccurate. A software driven online system can achieve much greater accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, by being online, real time stock information is available to you and all your employees all of the time meaning better management decisions and better customer services.</p><h2>Automatic Updating</h2><p>To some it may be an obvious thing, but it is easy to create a system that automatically reserves in stock items when a customer orders them, and automatically takes them out of stock when the order is despatched. This is one of the most common transactions your stock system should have to deal with. By doing it automatically you are ensuring that it is always done accurately.</p><h2>Accurate Reporting</h2><p>Accurate real time stock information is so valuable at every step of the <a href="../../ecommerce/" title="Information Explaining Ecommerce">Ecommerce</a> process that is hard to overstate. Build into that a zoning system so that the stock system can also tell your warehouse operatives on exactly which shelf the item is located and you have an incredibly useful and efficient stock control and inventory management system.</p>

<h1>Achieve Excellent Service with Greater Efficiency</h1>


<br/><p>Ecommerce technologies offer an excellent opportunity to offer the highest level of customer services with greater efficiency than you can dream possible. By utilising email as a primary communications platform, we can let software help us to deal with customer services tasks quickly or even automatically.</p><h2>Great Service</h2><p>We have found that pro active outbound customer services systems that keep your customers informed at every step of the way do wonders for your customer satisfaction levels. There is still a lot of uncertainty around shopping online and many customers may be relative newcomers to the idea, nervous about dealing online. Regular contact that keeps them fully informed and reassures them that you are dealing with their order in a prompt and professional manner makes your customers feel much more secure when dealing with you.</p><h2>Greater Efficiency</h2><p>With a bit of thought and investment, it is possible to build semi automatic and automatic customer services processes which will keep your customers fully up to date at all times with specific information about their order. This outbound email based information will keep your customers happy that the order is being processed, and will also give them the information that they might otherwise decide to call up and ask instead.</p><h2>Outbound not Inbound, Proactive not Reactive</h2><p>If you contact your customer before they contact you, this gives immediate customer satisfaction as you are making the ordering process that much easier by reducing the effort involved for your customers. By reducing the number of inbound calls and emails, a good proactive customer services system can reap huge efficiencies in staff time required to maintain customer services whilst maintaining an impeccably high standard of service. Furthermore, this reduction in inbound order enquiries gives your team more time to deal with potential sales, or more complex customer services enquiries.</p>

<h1>Fully Online Order Processing Systems</h1>


<br/><p>Ecommerce is very much about offering a product catalogue and then allowing people to place and pay for an order online. Once this order has been placed then it is down to your <a href="../../marketing/business/" title="Information Explaining Business">Business</a>es internal order processing system to progress the order through the various stages and finally to despatch. Of course there may well be post despatch problems etc which you will also need to be able to handle</p><h2>Easy Audit Trail</h2><p>A full centralised and online order processing system allows for an extremely easy audit trail. With a single order number, you can see the entire history of an order including all the decisions and communications that were made along the way. This makes things easier for your customer services staff which then means a much better experience for your customers.</p><h2>Every Step of the Way</h2><p>By utilising a well designed order processing system it is entirely possible to handle every single step of the order processing chain in the same online system. This means that your customer services representatives will be dealing with the exact same system as your warehouse operatives. Managers can easily keep track and monitor the activities of their teams. You can keep an eye on the overall operation from anywhere in the world!</p>
