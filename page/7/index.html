<p>The issue here is that a constraint is set up to prevent two rows containing the same value. Although key checks are disabled, it still can&rsquo;t add the rows. Sometimes as a useful technique to just get it running locally (obviously there&rsquo;s an issue here which does need resolving), simply change the &ldquo;INSERT INTO&rdquo; statement to &ldquo;INSERT IGNORE INTO&rdquo;, which will skip that entry.</p>

<p>I found that having error_reporting enabled wasn&rsquo;t enough</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><figcaption class='panel-heading'><h3 class='panel-title'></h3></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>You&rsquo;ll also need to add this to your index.php:</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><figcaption class='panel-heading'><h3 class='panel-title'></h3></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>You&rsquo;ll then be shown the following fatal error:</p>

<p>The issue here is that the contructor of Zend_Pdf_FileParserDataSource_File requires a single paramter, $filePath, whereas its abstract class&rsquo;s constructor does not. To resolve this, we need to make sure the abstract class matches its implementation, so make the following change</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><figcaption class='panel-heading'><h3 class='panel-title'></h3></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p><img src="/assets/conversion_rates_cover.png"></p>

<p>Every e-commerce web site owner would like to improve sales and one clear strategy to do this is to focus on increasing the conversion rate by effective use of website analytics leading to tested content changes that improve conversion.</p>

<h3>Why you Need to Start Doing this Today</h3>


<p>Let’s put it simple &ndash; without a proper use of analytics you are driving blind. You know that there is something happening but you really don’t know why, nor you can identify the bottleneck. We all know the saying &ndash; “A chain is only as strong as its weakest link” At that weakest spot you are losing most of your customers. If you can reduce the leak &ndash; more customers will make a purchase and your bottom line will be increased.</p>

<p>Check against these questions to make sure you do enough to catch and improve the bottlenecks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have you already set up analytics for your e-commerce web site? </li>
<li>If you have - are you set up to get all of the essential metrics? </li>
<li>Do you act on the data provided? </li>
<li>Are your conversion rates increasing?</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/assets/conversion_strategy.png"></p>

<h3>The Strategy in a Nutshell</h3>


<p>Analytics enable you to track every important aspect of your conversion funnel and any additional funnels that generates or somehow supports the main conversion. By proper use of analytics you can track even the smallest action in great detail, it helps to understand the actual user behaviour and make improvements. Most commonly the process is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set up the analytics and determine the most important actions and funnels to track</li>
<li>Let the tracking run for enough time to get a decent amount of data (from one week to a month and more)</li>
<li>Learn from collected data and look for the bottleneck which if were fixed would bring the largest benefit (conversion rate improvement) </li>
<li>Create a strategy on how to fix the bottleneck and set up a split testing to see the actual difference</li>
<li>Go for next bottleneck and repeat</li>
</ul>


<p>Website optimization is never done, it is always possible to make improvements by repeating tests and looking for best solution possible. Solutions change as time goes, industry evlolves and people’s needs change.</p>

<h3>What is Conversion</h3>


<p>In internet marketing, conversion rate is ratio of visitors who convert casual content views or website visits into desired actions. See the definition on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_rate" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>

<h3>Conversion Bottlenecks</h3>


<p>Conversion rate bottlenecks are the so called “bottlenecks” therefore they hurt your bottom line the most. You want you site to be intuitive and easy to use so your ecommerce site converts the most of the traffic into sales.</p>

<p>By setting up the analytics properly and learning from data you can see where are the most weakest spots and create a strategy on how to improve them.</p>

<p>Then start to test again and compare the results.</p>

<h3>Content Optimization by Experiment</h3>


<p>Once you have identified the bottlenecks you can start to experiment with different solutions to the problem. Every solution must be tested to make sure that it really reaches the goal effectively. That is why it is called experiment. You can not know for sure whether your new strategy will actually reach the goal more effectively and how much effectively.
Difference Between Improving Conversion and Increasing Traffic
The goals are the same &ndash; to increase the bottom line of your ecommerce business. However, the set of actions are completely different and they must come together to increase your income.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/conversion_rates.png"></p>

<p>By improving conversion rate your website will benefit more from the traffic it gets because more of the traffic will be converted. For example if you are getting:</p>

<ul>
<li>Traffic - 50000 visits a month</li>
<li>Conversions - 750 a month</li>
<li>Conversion rate - 1.5%</li>
</ul>


<p>Then obviously, in this oversimplified version of reality, you could either do the conversion rate optimization or increase the traffic, just flip the coin?</p>

<p>Not quite.</p>

<p>An increased traffic may not lead you to more sales as it would not persuade the customer to actually buy. Besides, you need the right target audience coming to your site which will more likely convert. However, if you do get to attract the right traffic it might double the conversion.</p>

<p>Then what is the difference?</p>

<p><strong>More traffic</strong> &ndash; your ecommerce site is more visible
<strong>More conversions</strong> &ndash; your ecommerce site is more usable</p>

<p>As you might notice then the second one is the one that makes the customer happy and builds long term relationships which results in return customer and again &ndash; results in repeated sale and increased bottom line.</p>

<p><strong>In short</strong> &ndash; conversion rate optimization is really vital to make your customer happy and to make more returning customers.</p>

<h3>Conversion and Usability</h3>


<p>Conversion rate and usability are going in hand-to-hand. The more usable your ecommerce site is, the more conversions you get.</p>

<h3>What is Analytics</h3>


<p>Business must be data-driven and that is exactly what analytics provide. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics" target="_blank">The simplest definition of analytics is “the science of analysis”</a>. It is the discovery and communication of meaningful patterns in the data.</p>

<h3>Google Analytics</h3>


<p><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> is a service offered by Google that generates detailed statistics about a website&rsquo;s traffic and traffic sources and measures conversions and sales. The product is aimed at marketers as opposed to webmasters and technologists from which the industry of web analytics originally grew. It is the most widely used website statistics service.</p>

<h3>Other Analytics Providers</h3>


<p><strong><a href="http://www.kissmetrics.com/why" target="_blank">Kiss metrics</a></strong>&ndash; lets you track the person not only overall data
<strong><a href="http://www.crazyegg.com/" target="_blank">Crazy Egg</a></strong> &ndash; provides you with heatmaps for eye tracking to understand onsite user behaviour.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>It used to be that importing products into Magento was incredibly time consuming and difficult to handle. Whilst recent updates to Magento has improved the Dataflow process it is still not a perfect solution.</p>

<p>To help get round this a project was set-up called <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/magmi/index.php?title=Main_Page" title="Magmi">Magmi</a> which allowed products to be imported directly, rather than using the Magento ORM. As this evolved it added more useful features and is now the only way that I handle importing products into Magento.</p>

<p>There are a couple of steps that need to be carried out before the system can be used properly. After it has been installed the first thing that needs to be done is to secure the web interface. This can be done using Basic Auth or IP restrictions in Apache. To generate a basic auth password for a .htaccess file you can use this <a href="http://tools.dynamicdrive.com/password/">handy tool</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have it secured the next step is to install some extensions to allow you to use some of the more advanced features. To install plugins you download them from here:<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/magmi/files/magmi-0.7/plugins/individual/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/magmi/files/magmi-0.7/plugins/individual/</a> and then extract them into the plugins folder.</p>

<p>Or you can use plugin packages and you can actually install these directly from the web interface if your server supports it (Thanks Dweeves).</p>

<p>The plugins are really what makes MAGMI so great as they allow you to do things like handle configurable products, categories and other things that standard dataflow and import/export are no where near being able to offer.</p>

<p>For advanced purposes it is possible to leverage the power of MAGMI in your own custom import purposes as part of a bespoke application using <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/magmi/index.php?title=Magmi_Datapump_API">MAGMI datapump</a>. We have used this technique for numerous clients when building a direct import from supplier feeds etc.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>When embarking on a project to launch or relaunch an e-commerce web site it can seem like a daunting and overwhelming prospect. The danger is that without proper planning and project management, the final outcome can be much less effective and efficient than if proper planning and preliminary research is used to define clear goals and then ensure these are met.</p>

<p>In my role as user experience designer, web designer and design project management I always advise clients to follow a clear and defined process to get the best results. The following describes this process in detail. If you have any questions regarding this article or would like to discuss your redesign or launch project with us please <a href="/contact-us">do get in touch</a>.</p>

<h3>Project Plan Overview</h3>




<blockquote><em>Abraham Lincoln - If I had six hours to chop down a tree, I&#8217;d spend the first four hours sharpening the axe.</em></blockquote>


<p>Planning is extremely important.</p>

<p>From what I&rsquo;ve learned I tend to break down every project in following phases.</p>

<ul>
 <li>1. Research and Planning</li>
 <li>2. Wire-framing</li>
 <li>3. Visual Design</li>
 <li>4. Front-end development</li>
 <li>5. Back-end development</li>
 <li>6. Content entry</li>
 <li>7. Testing</li>
 <li>8. Launch</li>
<li>9. Ongoing Support and Maintainence</li>
</ul>




<h2>Project Phases</h2>


<p>Here is some more details on the specific steps of a project.</p>

<h3>Research and Planning</h3>


<p>This phase is perhaps the most important. Discoveries made here will have a dramatic impact on decisions made later on in the project and the key is to ensure we gather as much high quality information as possible to facilitate the optimum plan for the project.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Requirements gathering – the most important phase. Try to get as much information as possible. It may take a lot of time at the beginning to set clear goals and strategies, but it will speed up the project management later on. That’s why it’s broken down to:

    <ul><li>Business requirements – what are the goals on the project monetization</li></ul>

    <ul><li>Design requirements – are there some special design considerations</li></ul>

    <ul><li>Technology Requirements – are there some limitations to platform or language, etc.</li></ul>

    <ul><li>User Requirements – who is this project created for, what’s the main audience, describe it as detailed as possible and create personas.</li></li></ul></ul>


<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Industry best practices / reports – see what’s already out there, what kind of research is available to speed up the learning curve. This step gathers very important information on which aspects to focus in competitor analysis.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Competitor analysis – see what strategies main competitors are using, identify their strengths and weaknesses, make short proposal of unique or best approach based on obtained intelligence. It really helps to create a checklist – to which against the competitors are analysed.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Overall Project Planning – after all of the basic information is gathered about the upcoming project, the competitors and the industry closely researched - create a basic proposal of what to include in the project and why (communicate the benefits). This is a good place for short recommendations on features, strategy, frameworks, platform, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></ul></p>

<h3>Wireframing</h3>


<p>Once the plan is in place we know everything that we want on the site. The next phase is to put together a wireframe (also referred to as a mockup) of the site that arranges the pages and structure of the site with all features. Wireframes are very simple layouts with no advanced colour or visuals and allow us to focus on layout and structure exclusively.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Site map – create a map of all included pages and write short user stories about them. It will play an important role to understand the total volume of the project and organize it. Help yourself as a web project manager - to keep with the plan and make sure that nothing is missed. It is a good visual material to present to your client as well.</li>

    <li>Low-to-High Fidelity Wireframes – Allows to define information hierarchy of each page and visualises the end-user behaviour. Start by determining layout by boxes only, simply play around various sceneries and get client feedback early. After conceptual layout is signed off, proceed to next phase by adding main typography elements and some real content to ensure that both - client and you are on the same track of understanding. Don&#8217;t worry that already signed off layout needs changes, it&#8217;s normal to evolve, after all - quality is what matters and the one who changes – survives. Feel free to use colour (I recommend Gray Scale) to set element priority within the wireframe. (For better wire framing and presenting I personally recommend <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/fireworks/2013/05/the-future-of-adobe-fireworks.html" title="The future of Adobe Fireworks" target="_blank">as Adobe announced to stop further development of Fireworks</a>)</li>

    <li>Functional specification – It’s extremely important to clarify all use sceneries and functions. Like what happens when item is added to cart and so on. Describe and visually enhance specification by adding meaningful images and annotations directly in wire-frames. Make sure to maintain close communication with Client and sign off the stage once it’s done.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Design</h3>


<p>Once the wireframes are completed and signed off with the client, the next phase is to start implementing those layouts as fully fledged visual designs. At this phase things like colour, shape and style become the focus. The design is in no way functional, the result is a flat image that will represent exactly how the web site will look.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Overall design – focus on first page, header and footer. Try to think over all elements and design rules, create the overall feel. This usually takes much longer time than any other section of site.</li>

    <li>Page design – just follow the wire-frames and overall design rules.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Completion</h3>


<p>When the designs are finalised the project passes across to the more technical side of the team for the process of making a live dynamic web site based upon the wireframes and designs.</p>

<p>The front end development phase is the conversion of the design into HTML, CSS and JavaScript that can be rendered in a web browser.</p>

<p>Back end development involves making your CMS system or platform such as Magento or WordPress generate the correct HTML and CSS, generally as part of a custom theme. This phase also includes building any custom functionality that is required or implied by the design.</p>

<p>Once the theme is live, the next phase is to populate the site with content. This could include products and categories, pages and articles or any other content that gives the site its true purpose and structure.</p>

<p>The final step before launch is to thoroughly test the site in a secure staging environment. Staging environments should be password protected with no chance of search engine spiders discovering and indexing the site before launch.</p>

<p>Once all parties are happy that the site is working perfectly, the final step is to launch the site. This generally involves deploying code and database to a live web server. Often this phase also includes some server setup and optimisation to ensure the site is working perfectly.</p>

<p>Once the site is launched, a phase of ongoing support and maintenance ensues which may last for weeks, months or indefinitely depending on the scale of the site and your ambitions for future growth and improvements.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>


<p>These are few of the basic guidelines for effective web project management. I don&rsquo;t insist that this is the one and the only right approach, it&rsquo;s just the approach that helps me to get the project done to the highest standards.</p>

<p>This approach is constantly evolving as new techniques and tools are discovered. I haven&rsquo;t gone into the details of development, testing and launch phases as this article is mostly focused on design and planning phases which is my primary role.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>If you have opted to have a customised mobile theme displayed for mobile users of your web site then it can be useful to be able to test this theme from the desktop. This is quite simple to do and there are plugins for most browsers. These days though Chrome users have this functionality built in, and quite nicely as well.</p>

<p>To access a mobile version of a site simply open Chrome and navigate to the site you would like to view in mobile version.</p>

<p>Then hit F12 to bring up the developer tools. Alternatively you can go to the right hand menu and select developer tools under the tools menu. This should bring up a screen looking similar to this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Screenshot-from-2013-06-03-162921-600x475.png"></p>

<p>In the bottom right hand corner of this screen you will see a little cog icon, please click that:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Screenshot-from-2013-06-03-162956.png"></p>

<p>This gives you the overrides menu where you can select the phone you want to emulate. You can also tick the device metrics box so that the displayable area corresponds to that of the phone giving you a good emultation of the phone experience.<img src="/assets/Screenshot-from-2013-06-03-163013-600x354.png"></p>

<p>Tick the box next to User Agent and choose a phone.</p>

<p>Once you have selected the phone you want to emulate under the &ldquo;user agent&rdquo; section and also optionally ticked the box next to &ldquo;Device metrics&rdquo; then you can reload the page (hit [ctrl] + [f5]) and the page will be reloaded and should show you the mobile version of your site.</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/ecommerce/13-best-practices-to-highly-effective-newsletter.html">13 Practices for Highly Effective Email Marketing</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Each email email must have specific and measurable goals defined. For example &ndash; to read an article, sell a product or sign up for an event. It&rsquo;s a Call to Action, a short but precise message which tells the recipient exactly what to do &ndash; no more, no less. The Call to Action is one of the most important email email elements; therefore it must be noticeable and inviting. This article will cover best practices on how to create a highly effective email.</p>

<p>If you are not sure on how to create a highly effective email that converts customers in to a successful sales leads, then here are the basic questions you need to ask yourself:</p>

<ul>
    <li>What I want my recipients to do?</li>

    <li>How will they know how to do it?</li>

    <li>How will they benefit from doing what I want?</li>
</ul>


<p>It sounds dead easy, but it&rsquo;s not that simple, because you don&rsquo;t want to scare away your customers with an overly insisting tone. On the other hand, if you don&rsquo;t give your recipient clear guidance on what to do it is most likely they will not do it.</p>

<p>Here are the core principles on how to create a highly effective email:</p>

<h3>1. The value of the email</h3>


<p>Your Call To Action must clearly communicate the benefits that the customer will receive. Benefits must be clearly visible, order them by priority.</p>

<h3>2. Use simple and convincing language</h3>


<p>Remember that your recipients are wise and most likely &ndash; very busy people. Therefore make the message as clear and simple as possible. Don&rsquo;t make their lives more complicated by using complex language and long paragraphs. Ease their decision and make the choice simple.</p>

<h3>3. Make the email urgent and limited</h3>


<p>When the message is urgent and somehow limited (for first 50 respondents or while product is in stock, etc), people are more motivated to act. Use words like Now, Today, Only, Limited, etc. Say why they must act now, explain the benefits.</p>

<h3>4. Catchy headlines</h3>


<p>Web users read by scanning the headlines, therefore they must be short, but catchy. The main point regarding the headline is not to sell the product (if you sell one), but to engage recipient to read the content of the email.</p>

<h3>5. Use numbers and make them meaningful</h3>


<p>Numbers deliver a clear message, they create an impression. However, numbers alone are meaningless, use them in context. For example, 4Gb of music storage is meaningless, say how many songs it can carry. Feel free to break it down even further.</p>

<h3>6. Ask questions</h3>


<p>Questions are great for attention grabbing. Especially, when you send a targeted email, you most likely know your audience and you know what they need. Make sure you ask. For example &ndash; Is your laptop too heavy? And follow with an immediate solution. Create questions so they are intriguing and recipients want to know more.</p>

<h3>7. Less is more. (Yes)</h3>


<p>Don&rsquo;t include too many Call To Actions. Don&rsquo;t over fill the email with products or offers. It is very easy for the recipient to get lost if there are too many adverts.</p>

<h3>8. Call To Action placement</h3>


<p>Remember to place your Call To Action in a highly visible location. If you have multiple Calls to Action make sure that the supporting information is clearly grouped. The primary message has to be as close to the top as possible with supporting information or offers taking position below the fold.</p>

<h3>9. Related design and style</h3>


<p>Your email email need to use represent your company and branding. Don&rsquo;t try to use different design, colours and overall style in your email. Recipients remember who you are (or at least they should), changing email design will only bring in confusion and most likely dramatically reduce the conversions.</p>

<h3>10. Use a consistent layout</h3>


<p>Your email must be well organized and content should be prioritized. Do this by placing elements within the layout. Once your email design is created, stick to it. Don&rsquo;t try to use different sizes and colours, unless you are testing various variations for better conversion rates.</p>

<h3>11. Use white space</h3>


<p>White space is good. It&rsquo;s not unused sales place. It actually helps the recipient to focus more on the proposal without distraction.</p>

<h3>12. Send relevant content to the right audience</h3>


<p>Emails shouldn&rsquo;t be generic. Most mistakes are made when a proposal is created that is very generic and sent out to everyone &ndash; it can apply to everybody on your list or none at all. Make sure that you know your audience and you send offers that are relevant to them. This can be done by automatically grouping customers by what they&rsquo;ve browsed or bought recently. This is normally called List Segmentation for example only emailing people who have bought a blue widget in the last six months.</p>

<h3>13. Don&#8217;t send for the sake of it</h3>


<p>Add value to your emails. Send offers that are really beneficial to the target customer. Make them anticipate your offer. If you send overly frequent and generic emails, you risk simply loosing subscribers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>If you use PDO and Fetch Object, it might not be clear exactly to access row properties that are based on columns that have spaces.</p>

<p>I know I searched for things like:</p>

<p>PDO Columns with spaces
PDO::fetchObject spaces
and PDO spaces in column names</p>

<p>I eventually found what I was looking for in the depths of the PHP.net comments however hopefully this post will be a little bit easier to find thanks to a bit of primitive SEO up there.</p>

<p>The solution to using columns with spaces is simply this:</p>

<p>The error itself is triggered from the saveAfter method in the Ebizmarts_SagePaySuite_Model_Observer_Sales class and is called every time an order is saved.</p>

<p>The error on the frontend was caused by a javascript error. Adding the following to the top of the sagePaySuite_Checkout.js file corrected it</p>

<p>The error in the admin was caused by a different extension being called when the order was saved. Normally the extension ensures that the method is not called when it is not needed and this is done by checking the route and the registry. If an extension saves the order these checks are not triggered so you will need to add in your own. To do that you will need add the following code to the action that is saving the error</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><figcaption class='panel-heading'><h3 class='panel-title'></h3></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
