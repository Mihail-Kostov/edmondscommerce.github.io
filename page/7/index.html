  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>UK based, highly skilled Magento developers are available to hire from Edmonds Commerce to work on yours or your clients projects.</p>

<p>Magento is an open source e-commerce platform written in PHP that has taken the world of e-commerce by storm. There are two versions of Magento available &ndash; Magento Community and Magento Enterprise.</p>

<p>The Community edition is perfect for most people. The Enterprise edition is the one you should use if you are more of an enterprise level business rather than a small SME or sole trader business.</p>

<p>Edmonds Commerce have been working with Magento for a few years now and have clients across the globe using both versions of the platform.</p>

<p>Our seasoned developers are all Zend Certified Engineers and the majority are Magento Certified Developers meaning your project will enjoy the highest levels of developer skill.</p>

<p>Get in touch with us using the form below to discuss how we can provide you the Magento developer resources you need.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>As you might be aware, the UK PHP Conference was held in London last weekend. Having been the lucky winner of a ticket from PHP NW I went along.</p>

<h3>The Venue</h3>


<p>The conference was held in The Brewery in London city centre, a well suited conference centre with a variety of different conference rooms. An old Whitbread brewery, it was modern and practical while still maintaining enough of its history to keep its character. Overall the venue was great and it was good to have the variety of different rooms for all of the different events</p>

<h3>The talks</h3>


<p>The talks on offer were on a wide variety of subjects, varying from the very specific libraries to things of use to any PHP developer. Each of the talks was led by a volunteer giving up their time to speak about a subject for which they held a passion, it came across very well and as ever is good to hear from active members of the community.</p>

<p>Talks I found to be of particular interest were</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>The Future of the PHP Development Environment</strong> A practical introduction to <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/" title="Vagrant">Vagrant</a>, demonstrating its purpose in creating a reliable, predictable server environment. Covered was the installation, configuration and use of the software</li>
    <li><strong>OpenStreetMap for the Web</strong> An enthusiastic demonstration of the power of having openly accessible data of the world&#8217;s maps and the APIs which enable a plethora of different applications</li>
    <li><strong>A Hands-On Introduction to Writing Unit Tests Using PHPUnit</strong> A very practical (with live coding and demonstration of the Unit Tests, a risky move that paid off) intro to unit tests in PHP. Aimed at the very beginner, it started slowly with very simple tests but showed the power of them in much bigger projects</li>
</ul>




<h3>In summary</h3>


<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the day, and would recommend anyone wanting to attend in future. The talks will be posted on the <a href="http://phpconference.co.uk/schedule" title="PHP UK Website" target="_blank">PHP UK website</a> in the coming weeks so you should be able to get a sample of the events there</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Edmonds Commerce employs a team of specialist PHP web developers who are all Zend Certified Engineers. This is a highly respected PHP qualification that ensures the highest standards of PHP development expertise. By achieving this certification we ensure that our developers have the kind of well rounded and deep understanding of the PHP language that can be utilised to achieve the highest quality production.</p>

<p>All of the e-commerce platforms, such as Magento and OpenCart are written in PHP and so the first thing to be sure of when you have a developer working on your projects is that they are very skilled in PHP itself as well as having an expert knowledge of the platform.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/screenshot-thumb3.png"></p>

<p>You can read all about the <a href="http://www.zend.com/services/certification/php-5-certification/" title="ZCE information" target="_blank">ZCE exam here</a>.</p>

<p>In a nutshell the exam is designed to test knowledge and skill that a professional PHP developer would need to tackle the kind of day to day issues they are likely to face. The exam covers a broad range of topics and really tests the in depth and broad knowledge of PHP that is required to really get the most out of the language and deliver the highest quality PHP development.</p>

<p>This is built for running Magento shell scripts (if you don&rsquo;t know about these, check them out) that are run on cron.</p>

<p>Also note the logging that keeps log files</p>

<p>Note the use of a character class in grep means it wont match itself &ndash; nice eh :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>As standard Magento comes with some excellent SEO features meaning that with little effort your site can be highly optimised for SEO. That said like anything there is always more that can be done. In the world of SEO this is generally always true, its an ongoing effort to keep your site at the top of the listings.</p>

<p>There are two main aspects to SEO which is &lsquo;on the page&rsquo; SEO meaning the content and structure of your Magento site and then &lsquo;off page&rsquo; SEO which involves building links and content external to your site. A modern SEO strategy involves careful application of both SEO methods to give you a natural and rounded SEO boost which avoids pitfalls of over optimisation and potential penalties from the main search engines and gives you a stable base to build strong rankings now and in the future.</p>

<p>Edmonds Commerce are happy work directly for you or closely with any SEO specialist or agency that you have involved to improve the on page SEO of your Magento store. Often an SEO specialist will be able to provide you with a list of issues that need resolving on your site to improve things and solve problems such as duplicate content.</p>

<p>There are a variety of common issues which we are able to advise on and resolve for you with well practiced techniques. If your site has some customisations or structure that is a little more unusual then the solutions may need to be a little more bespoke.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>One of the first things that users will notice about your web site is the design. The visual aspects of your site, the colour scheme, layout and also the general user experience (or UX in web speak) all contribute to the users impressions and willingness to interact with your site and go forth to place an order.</p>

<p>These days web design means more than just making it pretty, it also means making it work well across a variety of devices. For e-commerce sites we always recommend that clients look for a design that is clean and clear and does not get in the way of the core business of letting the user easily and quickly find the product they need and go through to purchase.</p>

<p>There are many choices when implementing a design for your Magento site and the budget range is significant &ndash; in fact the design is probably the most elastic part of any Magento implementation.</p>

<p>If you want to keep costs as low as possible we highly recommend you have a look at some of the excellent Magento themes that you can purchase for around the £100 mark. Of course there are some free ones and Magento is bundled with a small selection. In general these are so overused that it we recommend steering away from these and looking for something a little bit more exlcusive.</p>

<p>The next step up is to choose a template as a baseline but then get a visual design created that customises the template into something that is bespoke to your requirements. The level of customisation is really up to you and this is where the price elasticity comes into play, the more customisation the more you will need to budget.</p>

<p>Finally the top drawer service is a fully bespoke design implementation. This gives you the greatest levels of exclusivity and flexiblity. It means you will get a full design package that is perfectly tailored to your branding and target market.</p>

<p>Its worth considering at the design stage how you want to handle the experience that visitors using mobile or tablet devices will be delivered. Your options are essentially to serve up the exact same site as the normal desktop user, to have a custom theme delivered to these users or the solution we prefer is to implement a responsive design that will adapt to different screen sizes dynamically allowing a single web site theme to work across devices.</p>

<p>Whatever your requirements for Magento Design services &ndash; get in touch with Edmonds Commerce today and we will help you achieve the greatest results for your investment.</p>
