      <title>Ruby Syntax Highlighting with PHPStorm</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PHPStorm is my IDE of choice for PHP development of course and also as many other languages as I can get it to support. One of my favourite plugins for PHPStorm is BASH Support which makes it into a fully featured BASH IDE with function support and syntax highlighting and some code inspections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we are now moving to Octopress for blogging functionality I wanted a way to get Ruby syntax highlighting. There is a full blown IntelliJ based Ruby IDE but that is overkill for my needs. I had a look at Netbeans however it has now stopped supporting Ruby though there is a community supported plugin apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My best IDE solution so far is simply Vim, perhaps the &lt;a href=&#34;http://vim.spf13.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;spf13 flavour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit of Googling good old Stack Overflow came through for me with &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16451359/is-it-possible-to-get-ruby-syntax-highlighting-in-phpstorm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; that explains how to leverage PHPStorm&amp;rsquo;s TextMate bundle support to get Ruby syntax highlighting. This works a treat though on my colour scheme (a slightly modified Darcula) it was unreadable. The final thing to do is to change the settings under Settings &amp;gt; TextMate Bundles and in the grid at the bottom next to my theme I switched the TextMate colour scheme from Mac Classic to RailsCasts and now it looks good.&lt;/p&gt;
