      <title>Magento 1.8 released</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I got a notification through that Magento 1.8 had finally been released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been in beta since alpha since April, and contains server fixes that a lot of people have been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important one for UK vendors is that the rounding issue in tax calculations has been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also improvements to caching and database performance. The full release notes can be seen &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.magentocommerce.com/knowledge-base/entry/ce-18-later-release-notes&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are issues that have affected merchants since that change in the VAT rate, so we would recommend upgrading for everyone at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
