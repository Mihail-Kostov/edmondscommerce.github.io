      <description>&lt;p&gt;Easily deploy PHP applications to the Amazon Web Services infrastructure allowing you to take advantage of an easily scaled flexible cloud based system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore there is Git based deployment so your version control workflow can hook directly into deployment for speed and convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does really look attractive. The Angry birds store recently launched on Magento using Varnish and Amazon Web Services and it runs very fast indeed. Perhaps the days of expensive dedicated hardware are really numbered. If its this easy to set something up that can perform as well as a complex server cluster at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
