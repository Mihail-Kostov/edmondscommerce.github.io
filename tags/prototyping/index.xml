      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here at Edmonds Commerce we are always looking for new techniques and tools that allow to speed up and ease our internal work-flow which results in faster and more&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/web-project-management/guidelines-of-effective-web-project-workflow/&#34; title=&#34;Guidelines of Effective Web Project Management&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; effective project planning&lt;/a&gt;, management and development. We love to involve and closely collaborate with our clients as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just found this awesome c&lt;a href=&#34; http://www.invisionapp.com/&#34; title=&#34;Invisionapp - cross platform prototyping tool&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ross-platform mockup and interactive prototyping tool - Invision&lt;/a&gt; - which has an amazing feedback feature which could replace long email conversations. It is filled with lots of  active guides and how-to&amp;rsquo;s which makes it really understandable for clients. Actually, I find this part the most important about all the application. So far there have been a serious struggle with this particular phase - work showoff, iterations and final sign off. That is a long journey for traditional email conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://edmondscommerce.github.io/images/InvisionApp-Design.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image&#34; /&gt; InvisionApp interface&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent just a few moments with it, but it looks like 135.004 people in 70 countries aren&amp;rsquo;t trusting this awesome tool just for fun. (as it is stated on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.invisionapp.com/&#34; title=&#34;invisionapp homepage&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;invisionapp homepage&lt;/a&gt; when writing this post) Feels like I&amp;rsquo;ve finally found a well designed tool which has the most of the essential features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to take our clients on the journey of designing and iterating on their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Prototype For Mobile Devices Fast &amp; Easy?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://edmondscommerce.github.io/images/ProtoIO.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a designer who is keen on usability and user centric, well tested web systems I was in a desperate need of silly fast and useful mobile prototyping system. Up until recently I’ve used paper prototyping and later uploading images on various smart phones (always struggling with inaccurate representation of actual interface size, look and feel of the interactions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, that is the past and the future holds much brighter and functional solution for &lt;a href=&#34;https://proto.io/&#34; title=&#34;Proto.io - Rapid fast mobile prototyping&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;rapid fast mobile prototyping thanks to Proto.io &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see that they have been around for a while, which only brings lots of benefits to us – usability testers and designers. Prototyping application interface is improved and it has some really good functionality, although there is still room to grow like to support keyboard commands, more tutorials and find a way of making the overall work flow more intuitive as I found it hard to get into. Thankfully, proto.io team has created video tutorials for some of the most important questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I got the basic idea and figured out some work-arounds, I was able to upload my mobile site design in the application and create a working prototype. It is awesome, how fast and easy it is to test the prototypes on various devices. The most important feature I found is that I can access the fully working prototype from whatever device.&lt;/p&gt;
