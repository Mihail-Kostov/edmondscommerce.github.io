      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are making some design changes to your store and all of a sudden your home page has gone totally messed up then this might be your solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working with designs and design packages in Magento you must remember that design packages are referenced not only in the System-&amp;gt;Configuration or System-&amp;gt;Design sections, but also on a per product or per CMS page basis as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you remove, rename or otherwise alter a design package then its going to cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are having issues - remember to not just look at the layout files etc, but also look in the admin CMS section and check what design package settings you have there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is very simple to fix once you have figured out what&amp;rsquo;s causing it, but can take hours of frustration if you get rail roaded into examining the files for the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
