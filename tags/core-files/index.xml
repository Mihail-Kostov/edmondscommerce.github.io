      <description>&lt;h2&gt;Magento Upgrade with Custom Modules Rewrite&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this project was to upgrade a store from 1.3 to 1.5, without losing the functionality of the site. The old version had had its core files modified, requiring a forensic examination of them in order to find and extract what had been changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Love My Frames&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love My Frames is run by highly trained technicians with over 40 years&amp;rsquo; optical experience, offering the kind of personal service you would normally expect from a high street opticians. Offering the best for considerably less, professional service and door-to-door delivery, they give their customers the ultimate shopping experience online plus the opportunity to purchase the &lt;a href=”http://www.lovemyframes.com/” &gt;very latest designs at a great price&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://edmondscommerce.github.io/images/lovemyframes.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project asked for a clean install and then rewrite of the existing store. The biggest part of the project was taking the existing layered navigation and rewriting it to work on all pages with a custom design.&lt;/p&gt;
