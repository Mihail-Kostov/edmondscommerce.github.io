      <title>Prevent Ctrl&#43;S Freezing Your Terminal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As someone who types a lot of text everyday and am generally quite keen not to lose my work, I tend to hit the key combination [Ctrl]+[S] quite a lot.
In fact its almost become muscle memory that every sentence or two I will hit that combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working on a terminal, this can have the unfortunate outcome that the terminal freezes up. For more time than I would like to admit, I thought that this was a Linux bug
And found myself frequently restarting terminal sessions that had locked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I discovered that you can unlock this when it freezes by hitting [Ctrl]+[Q]. However this is a bit of a pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have now discovered a way of turning off this behaviour completely which is a real relief. Simply add the following to your .bashrc file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#Prevent Ctrl+S Freezing Terminal
stty -ixon
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit goes to this Stackoverflow post:

      <title>Vim Locking Up, Always When you are Ready to Save? Solution</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are constantly frustated by Vim freezing up on you are editing a file on a server then this is quite possibly your problem, and your solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is that most text editors and IDEs have [ctrl]+[s] mapped to save. If you do a lot of file editing then you probably bash the [ctrl]+[s] combo all the time, without even thinking about it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now back to Vim. As it is running in the terminal then it can be frozen by using the [ctrl]+[s] combination. You probably weren&amp;rsquo;t aware of that feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bring things back to life, just hit the [ctrl]+[q] combo. There are ways to permanently disable this which you can try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For full information on this, check out this great &lt;a href=&#34;http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12107/how-to-unfreeze-after-accidentally-pressing-ctrl-s-in-a-terminal&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;stack exchange page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
