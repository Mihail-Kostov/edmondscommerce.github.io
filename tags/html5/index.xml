&lt;p&gt;When something unbelievable happens, people tend to say “you were in the right place at the right time” that’s why you’re lucky. That is how I feel what happened to me here at Edmonds Commerce Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within first few weeks since I started working on Magento projects here at Edmonds. Nolwenn came to me with a question. “Hey Tadas, development team is going to this conference ‘PHP Yorkshire’, they don’t know what to expect, but it will be fun, will you join them?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then in my head I am like “Wow, my first weeks and I got this promising opportunity to spend the weekend knowing my colleagues better and listen to these passionate people who loves PHP”. Who could decline such offer? So off we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunny Friday evening, we are all set and heading to the city of York, which distanced just a bit more than hour from our office in Shipley. Few rounds of everyone&amp;rsquo;s preferred music requests and here we are, passing the door to explore York after we have left our belongings in the place we stayed overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-night-in-york-or-how-to-know-the-city-centre-within-3-pubs&#34;&gt;The night in York or how to know the city centre within 3 pubs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not into architecture, but York looked very appealing to me and it was my first time visiting it, definitely not last. I didn’t see any building there which would look out of sync. And the buzz of people on the Friday night was more on the calm side, just the way I like. But let’s move onto the fun stuff. So our first stop was just meters away from the place we stayed where we order some beer and appreciated the moment and the beginning of night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then another bar/pub and another. Everyone know how it goes, don’t we? The heading of this part might be too cheesy, you definitely can’t cover all the beauty of York within the distance of 3 pubs, but yeah&amp;hellip; York is great and the beer is great too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-big-day&#34;&gt;The Big Day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here we are, little bit tired from the night before, but we stood tall in the morning, ready to enjoy our day. I was amazed to be honest, that we were just right on time to begin our conference in the University of York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what was this all conference about? 1 day, 2 tracks, 13 experts. So after all, everyone was satisfied with how it ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest I enjoyed all of the talks I have participated in but the most memorable to me was about HTML5 API’s, naming things and object calisthenics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While my colleagues loved the speeches on GIT internals, handling errors gracefully, and they got answered what MySQL 8 is all about and why it is 8 and not any other number and Joseph have even won a MySQL dolphin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the weekend was enjoyable, I am glad I had a chance to be there, know my colleagues better and just be inspired by the talks and the community of PHP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Tadas&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Responsive Web Design for Mobile and Tablet Optimised Web Sites</title>
      <link>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/web-design/responsive-web-design-for-mobile-and-tablet-optimised-web-sites.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are at all involved or exposed to the world of web design and web development then you have no doubt heard of the phrase &amp;ldquo;responsive&amp;rdquo; web design. If you browse the popular theme sites for themes for platforms like WordPress and Magento then you can see responsive themes becoming more popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean and how does it work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What does Responsive Web Design Mean?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsive designs change the layout and visible content on a page depending on the width, height and other factors of the device or window rendering the page. You can generally test out responsive designs by simply unmaximising a browser window and then resizing it down to smaller sizes such as 320 pixels wide. On a normal design you would be quite lucky if the site still rendered in a readable way at that width. More than likely you will only be able to see a fraction of the page and would have to sideways scroll to see the rest of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a responsively designed site, the layout would change as the screen width gets smaller. It might hide certain elements such as side columns and may make things rearrange in a more vertical way to allow them to be displayed without the need for side scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, this is what responsive web design means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How Does Responsive Web Design Work?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsive web design works by using a CSS3 technique called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/&#34; title=&#34;W3C Media Queries Information&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Media Queries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSS has had the concept of media specific style sheets for quite some time. Traditionally though this was limited to print and screen, allowing for example to remove background images from a page when printing and perhaps adjust font family and size for better printing results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The media queries functionality extends this concept significantly, allowing custom style rules to be applied based upon a range of differnt media options. The most commonly used of these for responsive web design are width and height.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full list of properties that can be utilised with media queries include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;width
height
device-width
device-height
orientation
aspect-ratio
device-aspect-ratio
color
color-index
monochrome
resolution
scan
grid&lt;/blockquote&gt;
