      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently came across a forum post which I would like to quote here as I think it sums things up nicely. You can see the original post &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nublue.co.uk/forums/post/622/#p622&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Community edition has not been verified as PA-DSS compliant, which is not the same as PCI-DSS compliancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCI-DSS is the compliancy of your online environment, practices, software etc.  That is the standard that is required to be able to process on-site payments.
PA-DSS is not the same, it is part of PCI-DSS.  It&amp;rsquo;s a standard for the software that you are using for processing payments, just as PCI-DSS is the standard for the merchants processing payments on-site.  PA-DSS is the standard whereby the software provider subjects the software to a rigorous set of standards, tests and development practices (all viewable on the PA DSS Website) to confirm that the PA-DSS requirements are entirely met.
Anyone using Community edition has 2 options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 - use an off-site payment gateway, so none of this matters (the gateway will be PA-DSS software running in a PCI-DSS environment and PCI-DSS is not therefore required) - this is by far the easiest option available!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 - verify the software as PA-DSS compliant yourself by going through the PCI-DSS questionnaire and confirming the relevant data.
There is nowhere in the PCI-DSS questionnaire that says, &amp;ldquo;if your payment software has not been certified as PA-DSS compliant, you cannot be PCI-DSS compliant&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the basic tenets of PA-DSS compliancy is an essential part of becoming PCI-DSS compliant.
The only thing that PA-DSS provides, is a guarantee that any part of the compliancy questionnaire related to PA-DSS requirements (encryption of card #&amp;rsquo;s, cardholder data etc) is a certified yes, that does not require any investigation and confirmation from the client first.  These areas are all listed within the PCI-DSS SAQ (Self Assessment Questionnaire).  There is also a lengthy PA-DSS document on the website that lists the requirements of PA-DSS - the community edition, presumably, doesn&amp;rsquo;t meet these requirements, as it is a hook for paying for the Professional or Enterprise editions, as they have in turn paid and worked on having those editions verified, but don&amp;rsquo;t see the benefits to implementing this for the Community edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas the Pro/Enterprise editions will include certain best-practice features (such as auto-expiring passwords for instance) and of course are PA-DSS compliant, it&amp;rsquo;s also worth mentioning while we&amp;rsquo;re on the subject that they do not anywhere explicitly state that the Community edition is not PA-DSS compliant&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really means the PCI-DSS responsibility is further placed on the clients&amp;rsquo; shoulders; PA-DSS means you have one less thing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
