      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are now working on developing a new Magento based e-commerce site for a UK based company called Dressnimpress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our client specialises in designer clothing for both male and female and will be targeting a world wide marketplace for selling designer clothes covering all the latests and famous brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site will be developed from scratch by implementing designs that have been provided to us by the client. Part of the development process will include building a number of custom extensions to fulfil specific features of the site, customizing specific areas or pages of the site as per design and it will also have to support multiple currencies for the world wide audience.&lt;/p&gt;
