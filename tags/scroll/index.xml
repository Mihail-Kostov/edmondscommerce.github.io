      <description>&lt;p&gt;As someone who types a lot of text everyday and am generally quite keen not to lose my work, I tend to hit the key combination [Ctrl]+[S] quite a lot.
In fact its almost become muscle memory that every sentence or two I will hit that combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working on a terminal, this can have the unfortunate outcome that the terminal freezes up. For more time than I would like to admit, I thought that this was a Linux bug
And found myself frequently restarting terminal sessions that had locked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I discovered that you can unlock this when it freezes by hitting [Ctrl]+[Q]. However this is a bit of a pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have now discovered a way of turning off this behaviour completely which is a real relief. Simply add the following to your .bashrc file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#Prevent Ctrl+S Freezing Terminal
stty -ixon
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit goes to this Stackoverflow post:
