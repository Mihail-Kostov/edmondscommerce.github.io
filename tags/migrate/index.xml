      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are big fans of Google Apps and have built a large portion of our business processes around the system. For this reason we have absolutely no problem recommending the service to our clients and have assisted numerous clients with a migration to the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first benefit you will get is your emails migrated over and a much better email service. You have the option of using normal IMAP access so you can continue to use your preferred desktop application however we suspect that you will start to use the web interface as it is really quite powerful with some unique features that you can not access on a normal desktop client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with this you have great support of mobile devices, especially if you opt for Android with powerful and free native apps meaning that you can have all the access to your emails that could possibly wish for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the really excellent email functionality you also have powerful online documents giving you the basic office application functionality along with really powerful collaboration features allowing multiple people to be working on the same document simultaneously from geographically separate locations. This can be great when putting together proposals, specifications etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now called Google Drive, the documents system has grown from managing purely office documents into a fully featured online file store that can be used to store and share all kinds of files across your organisation and with third parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the calendar functionality is great. If you have never used Google Calendar then I suspect the first things you will notice is the abilty to easily drag and drop appointments around when reorganising your schedule. The ability to quickly create appointments using natural language such as &amp;ldquo;call steve at 11am&amp;rdquo; is really nice. A full barrage of reminders can be set up if you wish including on screen, SMS and emails meaning you should never miss an appointment again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all we think Google Apps is great and would love to help you move your organisation across to the system. If you would like to discuss this in more detail please do &lt;a href=&#34;http://example.com/contact-us&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;get in touch today&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edmonds Commerce are a Google Apps Reseller.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>osCommerce to Magento Migration with Redesign Starting from £1280</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Migrate your &lt;strong&gt;osCommerce, CRE Loaded or Zen Cart&lt;/strong&gt; store to &lt;strong&gt;Magento&lt;/strong&gt; for as little as &lt;strong&gt;£1280&lt;/strong&gt;. Get in touch today and we can discuss your particular requirements and help you at every step of the way in your migration to &lt;strong&gt;Magento&lt;/strong&gt;, without a doubt the best open source ecommerce platform available today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking of upgrading or migrating from your osCommerce, CRE Loaded or Zen Cart based store to Magento then you should definitely get in touch with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edmonds Commerce have years of experience working with osCommerce and its derivatives and know the platform inside out, back to front. We have done all kinds of things with osCommerce and still have a large number of clients still using the platform with great success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However Magento is becoming more and more of an attractive option. It is new, modern, powerful and is definitely on the up. Certain Magento features, such as the multi store would be so hard to achieve with an osCommerce based store (or CRE Loaded, Zen Cart) that a migration to Magnento is the only realistic option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edmonds Commerce are one of the UK&amp;rsquo;s leading Magento specialists, we have worked on a large number of Magento sites for a wide range of clients in all kinds of industries. We spotted Magento on the up when it was still in its infancy. We knew that osCommerce was getting a bit long in the tooth and the market was wide open for its successor as the most popular open source ecommerce platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years later and it has certainly achieved that status, eclipsing osCommerce in every way apart perhaps from the number of sites running it. Having been around for a long time and being very successful, there are still a large number of sites using osCommerce (or CRE Loaded, Zen Cart). However we are now seeing more and more new and existing clients looking to move away from osCommerce and onto Magento.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are able to help you perform and smooth and seamless transition from one platform to the other. We can migrate all the necessary data over and get your new store working perfectly and to your satisfaction before making a seamless switch so you suffer no down time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to get some Magento training we are also able to help you with this, offering both classroom based Magento training in Leeds, West Yorkshire and online training for those for whom Leeds is a bit difficult to get to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you would like to know more or get in touch&lt;/b&gt;
Please &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/contact-us/&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;click here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to go to our contact form and get in touch with us regarding osCommerce to Magento migrations by osCommerce and Magento experts.&lt;/p&gt;
