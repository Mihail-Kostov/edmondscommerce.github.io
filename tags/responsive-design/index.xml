      <description>&lt;p&gt;Magento has released the latest version of both CE and EE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big changes that are included are as follows&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsive design included as default&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both editions now come with a responsive theme. This introduces jQuery, SASS, and Compass into native Magento and should allow for easier customisation in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill Me Later&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PayPal integration has been upgraded to include the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/promotional-financing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bill Me Later&lt;/a&gt; financing option. This allows customer to pay for products over six months whilst the merchant gets paid straight away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other security fix and performance fixes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full list of changes can be seen &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.magentocommerce.com/knowledge-base/entry/new-features-ce19-ee114&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Great Way of Cross-platform Prototyping - Invisionapp</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here at Edmonds Commerce we are always looking for new techniques and tools that allow to speed up and ease our internal work-flow which results in faster and more&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/web-project-management/guidelines-of-effective-web-project-workflow/&#34; title=&#34;Guidelines of Effective Web Project Management&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; effective project planning&lt;/a&gt;, management and development. We love to involve and closely collaborate with our clients as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just found this awesome c&lt;a href=&#34; http://www.invisionapp.com/&#34; title=&#34;Invisionapp - cross platform prototyping tool&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ross-platform mockup and interactive prototyping tool - Invision&lt;/a&gt; - which has an amazing feedback feature which could replace long email conversations. It is filled with lots of  active guides and how-to&amp;rsquo;s which makes it really understandable for clients. Actually, I find this part the most important about all the application. So far there have been a serious struggle with this particular phase - work showoff, iterations and final sign off. That is a long journey for traditional email conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://edmondscommerce.github.io/images/InvisionApp-Design.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image&#34; /&gt; InvisionApp interface&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent just a few moments with it, but it looks like 135.004 people in 70 countries aren&amp;rsquo;t trusting this awesome tool just for fun. (as it is stated on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.invisionapp.com/&#34; title=&#34;invisionapp homepage&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;invisionapp homepage&lt;/a&gt; when writing this post) Feels like I&amp;rsquo;ve finally found a well designed tool which has the most of the essential features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to take our clients on the journey of designing and iterating on their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Firefox and Responsive Web Design</title>
      <link>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/css/firefox-and-responsive-web-design.html</link>

      <guid>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/css/firefox-and-responsive-web-design.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Responsive web design is an excellent way to make a site work really well for a variety of different screen sizes without having to serve more than one design to users. Responsive web design does pose additional challenges however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the challenges for you, as the developer, are being able to implement, test and debug the design implementation. Fortunately built in to Firefox&amp;rsquo;s arsenal of developer tools is an interface for exactly that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets take a website that uses a responsive design:
&lt;img src=&#34;http://edmondscommerce.github.io/images/large-no-tools-600x396.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image&#34; /&gt;
Here is the &amp;lsquo;mobile&amp;rsquo; view:&lt;img src=&#34;http://edmondscommerce.github.io/images/small-no-tools.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So every thing is normal you can use the developer tools and Firebug or whatever. If you then need to make changes to the smaller version and use Firebug you would have to pop out Firebug (which may or may not be to your preference) then resize the main window. This works ok but Firebug currently isn&amp;rsquo;t great for working with responsive designs as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show you all the rules that might apply based on the screen size and other conditions. This is one area that the Firefox built in tools beat Firebug. The styles editor shows you all rules that could apply and their conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To activate Firefox&amp;rsquo;s responsive design view press Ctrl + Shift + M. You can open the inspector and stlyes by pressing Ctrl + Shift + I. You can also access the responsive design view by going to Tools &amp;gt; Web Developer. With responsive design view enabled you can still use Firebug without a problem, unless you enable the built in element inspector then you kind of lose loads of screen space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://edmondscommerce.github.io/images/small-tools-600x447.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
