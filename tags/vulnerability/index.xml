      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a current vulnerability with skype accounts where anyone who knows your email address can get access to your account, and even your private chat logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Kaspersky Labs (a leading computer security firm), the leader of the Russian Opposition has had his private chat logs leaked via this method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a serious vulnerability and Microsoft (the current owners of skype) are looking into the issue.  At present there&amp;rsquo;s no way to avoid the compromise, perhaps think about clearing your logs if you have anything private in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a good article &lt;a title=&#34;The Register&#34; href=&#34;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/14/skype_disables_password_reset_bug/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that explains in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
