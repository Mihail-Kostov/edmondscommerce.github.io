      <description>&lt;h2&gt;What DNS is&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNS (Domain Name System)&lt;/strong&gt; is the system used to make sure that when users type in your web address into their browser, they end up on your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How communication happens on the internet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using the web, every site has its own address. It might have extra bits on the start and end, but the core part will be &amp;ldquo;yoursitename.com&amp;rdquo;, or similar. This is your &lt;strong&gt;Domain Name&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, servers have a unique number assigned to them, similar to how houses have phone numbers. This will look something like &amp;ldquo;123.456.789.000&amp;rdquo;. This is called an &lt;strong&gt;IP Address&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like phone numbers, the problem with IP addresses is that they&amp;rsquo;re hard to remember. It&amp;rsquo;s not easy to tell other people a list of numbers and have them remember them when they get home. It&amp;rsquo;s for this reason we have phone books. Fortunately the internet has its own built in way of looking up IP addresses by a name. This is where DNS comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DNS is a way of looking up an IP address by a more memorable name. When you type in &amp;ldquo;google.com&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s actually being converted into an IP address without you realising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How Domain Names are converted into IP Addresses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you buy your domain from your registrar, you will also be provided an area where you can set up &lt;strong&gt;DNS Records, also called Zone Records&lt;/strong&gt;. This is where you, or your development company, set up the conversion from the Domain Name to the IP address. When this is populated, people accessing your domain are able to end up on your server because of this translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In actual fact, this information is spread across the world so that every &lt;strong&gt;DNS Server&lt;/strong&gt; in the world (a place where the translation happens) knows what your IP address is, exactly like sharing a phone book with the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This translation information is transmitted with a validity period, which is how often other DNS Servers should ask for updates. This is called a &amp;ldquo;Time To Live&amp;rdquo;, or TTL). This is generally set to a relatively high time, and is the reason you generally have a 24 hour wait period when you change where your site is hosted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Separating your Domain Registrar from your Name Server&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s possible (and not unusual) to have the &lt;strong&gt;Domain Registrar&lt;/strong&gt; (the company you bought the domain from) and the &lt;strong&gt;Name Server&lt;/strong&gt; (the place where you update these DNS records) in completely different places. This is set up by telling your Registrar where your Name Servers are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When this is changed, it means that the Registrar is no longer in control of the translation from Domain Name to IP Address&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The General Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when you access a website, here is what&amp;rsquo;s actually happening behind the scenes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You type in the web address into your browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your browser asks a DNS Server what the corresponding IP address is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DNS server sends the IP address back to your computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your browser then knows which specific IP address to send subsequent messages to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The browser takes this IP adress and sends a message to the server it&#39;s assigned to for the web page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The server sends back the page to your computer, and it&#39;s displayed on your screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Google Drops Google Apps Free Tier</title>
      <link>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/email/google-drops-google-apps-free-tier.html</link>

      <guid>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/email/google-drops-google-apps-free-tier.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a move that will hurt a lot of small businesses and especially startups, Google have withdrawn their free Google Apps for Domains which has been slowly reducing in number of users from 50, to 10 to now 0 (almost).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are keeping the existing accounts open so if you have Google Apps already, don&amp;rsquo;t panic yet, your data is still there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one-man-band startups apparently there is the option of creating a single-user apps account still apparently, according to Greg D&amp;rsquo;Alesandre of Google.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>osCommerce PHP 5.2 Upgrade - You Really Should Get onto PHP 5.3 ASAP</title>
      <link>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/oscommerce/oscommerce-php-5-2-upgrade-you-really-should-get-onto-php-5-3-asap.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2012 17:36:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/oscommerce/oscommerce-php-5-2-upgrade-you-really-should-get-onto-php-5-3-asap.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many of our clients use &lt;a href=&#34;http://edmondscommerce.github.io/platforms/oscommerce&#34;&gt;osCommerce&lt;/a&gt; for their online store. osCommerce was very popular a few years ago and to date still powers a really large number of stores. Due to a variety of technical reasons, many osCommerce stores are still hosting on PHP version 5.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest version of PHP is 5.4 and 5.5 is due out fairly soon. Most hosting companies will now regard PHP 5.3 to be the minimum version they will support. By switching to PHP 5.3 they get better performance and better security. Unfortunately if you are running an osCommerce store and your hosting company decides to upgrade PHP then you might find that your entire store stops working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first instinct here is to get your store back online as quickly as possible and that is entirely understandable. These days though we really think that osCommerce store owners should be running on PHP 5.3. It is entirely possible to do this and does not necessarily entail a large amount of work depending on which contributions you are running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last release for PHP 5.2 was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.php.net/archive/2010.php#id2010-12-16-1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;version 5.2.16 released back in 2010&lt;/a&gt;. In software terms that is really quite a long time ago and really underlines how much of an issue this is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read about some of the performance gains of switching to PHP 5.3 or greater on &lt;a href=&#34;http://php.net/manual/en/features.gc.performance-considerations.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like some help getting your osCommerce store working on an up to date version of PHP then &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://edmondscommerce.github.io/contact-us&#34;&gt;get in touch with Edmonds Commerce today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course another option is to think about moving away from osCommerce and onto a more up to date platform such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://edmondscommerce.github.io/platforms/oscommerce&#34;&gt;osCommerce&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://edmondscommerce.github.io/platforms/opencart&#34;&gt;OpenCart&lt;/a&gt;. If you are thinking of ugprading then 5.3 compatability will be a bonus. If you are not thinking of upgrading platform any time soon though you really do need to schedule in an upgrade to PHP 5.3 at the earliest opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SSH Access, what is it all about in Simple Words?</title>
      <link>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/server/ssh-access-what-is-it-all-about-in-simple-words.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Nov 2012 16:29:37 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/server/ssh-access-what-is-it-all-about-in-simple-words.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is an SSH access?&lt;/h3&gt;
SSH stands for Secure Socket Shell. SSH is a protocol, like HTTP, it gives us a way to gain a secure access to remote computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principle is to connect two networked computers via a secure encrypted channel within an insecure network environment such as the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With SSH access we can easily move files around and run programs on your server. We can also transmit files to and from our own network onto your server, for example to take a copy of your site for local development or to push updated files onto your server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSH needs a server application installing on your server (most web servers will have this by default) and an SSH client on your local machine to allow you to connect to your server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where do you get your SSH access from?&lt;/h3&gt;
If you need SSH access details you should ask your hosting company, they should be able to install it for you if it is not already in place. If you are on shared hosting then the chances are that you will not be able to get SSH access details, if you need SSH access then you should consider upgrading your hosting to something that will support it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSH access details will consist of at least:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;domain or IP address:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
domain.com

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
123.123.123.123

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;username:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
mywebserverlogin

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;password:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
ihy324579ySDWf

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it may also include a port if SSH is not running on the standard port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
2020

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we need the SSH access details?&lt;/h3&gt;
We will always ask our customers to provide us with SSH access details. This is for two main reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Power and Speed&lt;/h4&gt;
SSH access allows us to run commands directly on the server, compress files, run scripts etc. For example we will generally run some static analysis scripts for our &lt;a href=&#34;http://edmondscommerce.github.io/platforms/magento&#34;&gt;Magento&lt;/a&gt; customers using a bash script that we can run with SSH access. This gives us some instant feedback on the state of your Magento installation and allows us to spot any potential problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we need to get a copy of your site files, using SSH we can prepare a compressed archive of your site files allowing us to download them much faster. Likewise we can easily get a reliable database dump, especially if you have a large database that might cause problems for browser based tools such as phpMyAdmin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Security&lt;/h4&gt;
SSH is a much more secure protocol than something like FTP. In SSH everything is encrypted. It has been built from the ground up to be a very secure way of networking and inter communicating between servers on an insecure network such as the web.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Live Images on Staging Without Absolute URLs (but a bit of JS)</title>
      <link>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/javascript/using-live-images-on-staging-without-absolute-urls-but-a-bit-of-js.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2012 11:05:49 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/javascript/using-live-images-on-staging-without-absolute-urls-but-a-bit-of-js.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have a staging copy of your site anywhere then you might not bother copying over your entire catalogue of product images etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might decide to drop in absolute URLs for those images so that they are pulled from live. However you really don&amp;rsquo;t want absolute URLs in your code and you certainly don&amp;rsquo;t want that to go live because it just adds unnecessary bloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice trick you can do here is make a change to your staging site as follows. Of course ensure this change doesn&amp;rsquo;t go live, but it should be just one file so that&amp;rsquo;s easy to handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note this assumes you already have jQuery available on your page)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;text/javascript&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;ready&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;img&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;each&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;attr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;src&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;        
        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;indexOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;http&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)){&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;new_src&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;http://www.LIVEDOMAIN.co.uk/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>How To Extract Files from Plesk Backups</title>
      <link>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/plesk/how-to-extract-files-from-plesk-backups.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2012 17:25:16 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/plesk/how-to-extract-files-from-plesk-backups.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So you have a plesk backup file and you want to extract and open the files from it? No problem. This blog will show you how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file is a mime file. The &amp;ldquo;mpack&amp;rdquo; package will let you unpack it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we install the &amp;ldquo;mpack&amp;rdquo; package&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install mpack
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine your file is called &amp;ldquo;pleskDump.gz&amp;rdquo;. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a &amp;ldquo;.gz&amp;rdquo; at the end it might not be bad to add it as some environments will complain if it&amp;rsquo;s absent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we unzip the file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gunzip pleskDump.gz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s un-mime the file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir pleskDumpOutput
cd pleskDumpOutput
cat ../pleskDump | munpack
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have a bunch of regular tar files, but be careful, if we just extract them, the root folders will not be recreated. In order to keep things together, it&amp;rsquo;s best now to look at the output you have. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a made up example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;example-domain.com.httpdocs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the format is essentially domain.rootfolder or in another way, the tar files have your domain name they are archiving, then a dot, then the name of the root folder they made up. We take that root folder and create it like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir rootfolder
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s apply that idea to our previoud example; &amp;ldquo;example-domain.com&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir httpdocs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to untar into the folder you just created, let&amp;rsquo;s assume you just created &amp;ldquo;httpdocs&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;tar -xvf example-domain.com.httpdocs -C httpdocs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you go! You can now output any of the folders you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simple way to check Magento email setup</title>
      <link>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/simple-way-to-check-magento-email-setup.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2011 15:58:30 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/simple-way-to-check-magento-email-setup.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, you&amp;rsquo;ve just moved a magento setup from one host to another, and you want to check if the email setup is correct, how do you do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple easy way to do this is to have a test front-end user (which you probably already have) and send a password change email to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple trick but a good timesaver.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magento admin backend slow (quick speed tip)</title>
      <link>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-admin-backend-slow-quick-speed-tip.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2011 12:48:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-admin-backend-slow-quick-speed-tip.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that can catch you out if you have a paranoid server admin is that various magento extensions will contact external servers (such as SagePay or Mailchimp).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the server admin has blocked outbound web traffic (to avoid DDoS attacks and other malicious traffic), these extensions will slow you down at every step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple answer, if you&amp;rsquo;re running magento, ensure you have outbound traffic enabled.  Also, don&amp;rsquo;t assume that just because you can use lynx, apt-get et al at the command prompt that you can as the web server user.

      <title>Starting an Ecommerce Business,  in a Nutshell</title>
      <link>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/ecommerce/starting-an-ecommerce-business-in-a-nutshell.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2011 16:19:59 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/ecommerce/starting-an-ecommerce-business-in-a-nutshell.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;oldpost&#34;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;This is post is now quite old and the the information it contains may be out of date or innacurate.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you find any errors or have any suggestions to update the information &lt;a href=&#34;http://edmondscommerce.github.io/contact-us/index.html&#34;&gt;please let us know&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/edmondscommerce/edmondscommerce.github.io&#34;&gt;create a pull request on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
It may be obvious but after a discussion in the office we decided to put together a simple guideline for getting into e-commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a list of things that you need to do in order to start selling from your own web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get a Domain Name&lt;/b&gt;
These are so cheap yet so fundamentally important it really should be one of the first things you do. Always ensure you can get the .com even if you intend to run from the .co.uk. If budget allows, buy all the top level domains you can afford simply to ensure they are yours - eg .com, .net, .co.uk, .org.uk, .info etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Find a Supplier&lt;/b&gt;
The first thing you need is a supplier that you can buy from cheap enough to markup and earn a reasonable profit. Often this is one of the hardest bits, especially when you are starting out, finding a supplier that will agree to supply you can be tough. Be prepared to pay for stock up front initially and also to take on stock holdings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You May need Retail Shop&lt;/b&gt;
Even though you intend to make ecommerce the primary focus of your business, you may find some suppliers simply will not work with you if you do not have a retail shop. You need to double check this. Some times it is enough to have a few counters or a display rack in your warehouse, or some kind of &amp;ldquo;trade counter&amp;rdquo;. Other times you may really need a plate glass high street store front to get supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decide on your Fulfillment&lt;/b&gt;
You need to decide how you are going to fulfill customer orders. Are you going to do everything yourself? Are you going to use a fulfilment company to take care of this for you. You may find that your supplier(s) offer a drop shipping service where they will fulfill orders directly for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decide on Shipping Methods and Charges&lt;/b&gt;
Are you going to offer next day courier? Do you need to worry about insurance? Can you get away with Royal Mail? There are lots of things to consider when thinking about this aspect of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Merchant Account&lt;/b&gt;
If you want to take credit card payments, and any serious ecommerce business should - I definitely believe it is not enough to simply offer paypal - then you are going to need a merchant account. You will also need a business account - these do not have to be from the same bank, though they would have you believe they do. Shop around for the best rates - this can have a distinct impact on your bottom line, especially if margins are tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Payment Service Provider&lt;/b&gt;
The payment service provider is the system that will actually allow customers to enter card details and will report transactions back to your merchant account. Again its worth shopping around for the best rates. Bear in mind you can only have one PSP per merchant account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Choose your Shopping Cart Platform&lt;/b&gt;
You need to choose which platform you want to base the site on. Choices generally include Magento which is without a doubt the most popular and powerful, Open Cart, osCommerce and derivatives are still popular though not really for new sites these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get a Design&lt;/b&gt;
Your choices for design range from using an off the shelf theme which is the cheapest option through to getting a full custom design created. If you are looking for templates, simply search google for {platform} template or {platform} theme. For example &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.co.uk/search?gcx=c&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;channel=cs&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=magento+templates&#34;&gt;Magento Templates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Implement your design on your Cart&lt;/b&gt;
If you have chosen a template then this is usually a case of installing that template and then making whatever customisations you want/need to make in order to brand the site with your logos, colour schemes etc. If you have chosen to go for a custom design then this is a much larger task but the end result is something that is exactly what you want. This is definitely something that Edmonds Commerce can help you with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Load your Product Data&lt;/b&gt;
You need to populate your store with product information. In its barest form this should include name, description, SKU, price and images. You may find getting the data is tricky. Alternatively you may be lucky enough to have suppliers that offer a full data feed and images for their products making this very easy. If you need to bridge the gap, getting a custom scraper built to get product data from your suppliers web sites can be a very cost effective solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Choose a Hosting Company&lt;/b&gt;
Whilst your store is in development you will not generally need hosting. All of our client work is carried out on our local environment and staging server. It is only when the site is ready to go live that hosting is required. When choosing a host there is lots to consider. The first and most obvious is the hardware spec of your server. Are you going to go for the cheapest shared hosting, a VPS with reasonable power or a dedicated with large RAM and CPU resources?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other big question that I think a lot of people do not consider in enough detail is the level of support you need from your hosting company. This has a dramatic impact on the price. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to get a very powerful dedicated for around the £100 per month mark. However don&amp;rsquo;t bother calling the support line at 2am on a Saturday Morning. If you need full phone support, especially 24/7 then expect to pay for this. I would also advise trying to ring the support lines at these kinds of times just to check that it really is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Launch Your Store&lt;/b&gt;
You can launch your store as soon as you have product data and a means of payment set up and the store is accessible by visiting your domain name. There are different schools of thought on when you should launch. One is that you should not launch until your site is 100% finished and ready to impress your visitors with its sheer amazingness. Another school of thought is that you should launch ASAP to allow search engine spiders to get in and also to allow visitors to start trickling in allowing you to ensure your systems are all working properly before you switch on the more powerful marketing that will drive large traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Register Self Employed&lt;/b&gt;
If you are starting out in business you need to remember to register yourself as self employed with the revenue. Here is some more &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/selfemployed/register-selfemp.htm&#34;&gt;info&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unleash the Marketing&lt;/b&gt;
Your store will not succeed unless you have an effective marketing strategy in place. This could involve simply SEO + PPC or might extend through to TV adverts, billboards etc. The main differentiator is scale and budget. SEO is a long term strategy, it is unlikley you will achieve great results from the get go. PPC offers an instant response though the costs can be very high so maintaining profitability can be a concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Continuous Improvement&lt;/b&gt;
Once your ecommerce business is up and running you should commit yourself to a continuous cycle of improvement. It&amp;rsquo;s the only way to ensure you stay ahead of the game and achieve the level of progress you desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to plan on the fact that you will need to periodically upgrade your shopping cart. Especially if you are using Magento - it is being updated all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magento Hosting Optimisation Tips</title>
      <link>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-hosting-optimisation-tips.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2011 17:23:44 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-hosting-optimisation-tips.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to gain the most out of your Magento hosting and to optimise your Magento hosting stack, here are a few top tips that you can try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Ensure Caching is Enabled&lt;/b&gt;
It may sound obvious, but if you do not have caching enabled then the performance of your Magento store is going to suffer massively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally whilst developing, caching will need to be at least partially disabled to ensure that changes are reflected. Unfortunately some times when a site goes live, enabling caching is a forgotten step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Upgrade your Magento&lt;/b&gt;
More recent versions of Magento offer much better performance than earlier versions. If you are running a Magento version older than 1.4 then you should definitely look to upgrade as soon as possible as there are vast improvements to be made in terms of performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Disable or Improve Bad Extensions&lt;/b&gt;
Some custom modules or forum inspired template hacks can be functionally fine but absolutely terrible in terms of performance. Fancy a best sellers list? Lets calculate the top ten products on every single page load and display the results in the right hand column!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Use Block Caching&lt;/b&gt;
In order to deal with the above scenario, it is fairly easy to use block caching - something built into Magento as standard - to cache the html output of a block and serve from the cache rather than doing lots of heavy processing on an unnecessarily regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Move Hosts&lt;/b&gt;
Some times you just have to accept  that your hardware or hosting is no up to scratch. A well optimised LAMP stack can out perform an unoptimised standard stack by a surprising degree. Combine that with some choice extensions such as opcode caching etc and the performance difference can be really quite significant - and without any hardware upgrades. If you are running a VPS or dedicated server then it is possible to optimise the stack yourselves, or hire an agency like us to help you with this. Alternatively you can try to move hosts to a more specialist Magento hosting company that will provide this service as standard.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magento Optimised Hosting</title>
      <link>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-optimised-hosting.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2011 07:17:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-optimised-hosting.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Edmonds Commerce have been with Magento since the beginning. If you would like us to optimise your VPS or dedicated server for Magento then please &lt;a href=&#34;http://edmondscommerce.github.io/contact-us/&#34;&gt;get in touch today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back then the speed of Magento was one of its main drawbacks. Since that time, the code has improved a lot and things have generally got a lot better but one thing that has become clear over the years is that Magento really does require a well optimised hosting platform to perform the best. Conversely, hosting Magento on a badly configured or none optimised hosting stack will have a really detrimental effect on the performance of the store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using shared hosting then you are a bit stuck. Magento optimised shared hosting is available and there are some good companies out there that we would be happy to recommend for you. If your current store is not performing well though and you are on shared hosting then the likelihood is that the only solution is to either upgrade to some kind of dedicated or virtual private server, commonly shortened to VPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A VPS or VDS as they are some times called is what is known as a virtual machine. It is a full instance of an operating system (Linux) running on hardware that is actually running multiple virtual machines from one real server. In some respects this is like shared hosting, however the difference is that on a VPS you have a fully dedicated, private and customisable operating system that can be configured and optimised as required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course if you have a real dedicated server then you have the same benefits of a VPS and also enjoy dedicated hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, as soon as you have a dedicated operating system you are free to configure your database, web server and PHP however you wish. Generally though this is too technical for most people. This is where we come in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are happy to provide for you a full VPS or dedicated server Magento optimisation service. Our Magento hosting optimisation service will ensure you are getting the best out of your current hosting package. It means that you are not required to move hosts if you are generally happy them, but you can be assured that you are running on a highly optimised Magento stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that sounds interesting and you would like to discuss this in more detail, simply &lt;a href=&#34;http://edmondscommerce.github.io/contact-us/&#34;&gt;get in touch today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL Got Error 28 From Storage Engine &#43; Solution</title>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
If you get the error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Got error 28 from storage engine query&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are trying to access your web site, database or phpMyAdmin then the problem is likely to be that you have run out of hard disk space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have command line access you can quickly check this by running&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
df -h

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do see a partition with low or no space then the solution is simply to find and remove files that are not required and you should be back up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magento Hosting Check Script - Also Checking for Optimisation</title>
      <link>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-hosting-check-script-also-checking-for-optimisation.html</link>

      <guid>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-hosting-check-script-also-checking-for-optimisation.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To try to help clients who are choosing a hosting platform for Magento, we have modified the already available Magento Check script and extended it to also check for optimisation and some other key requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you can see the script here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&#34;text/javascript&#34; src=&#34;http://snipt.net/embed/cf6ca04739bafcd4834dc1b7bfd9b838&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m using a snipt rather than pasting the code directly in so that if we update it in future, this post should always contain the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magento cPanel Backup Issue - Not Backing up the Core Folder &#43; Solution</title>
      <link>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-cpanel-backup-issue-not-backing-up-the-core-folder-solution.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2010 13:06:28 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-cpanel-backup-issue-not-backing-up-the-core-folder-solution.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are hosting a Magento site on cPanel powered hosting and are relying on the cPanel backup system to manage backing up your files then you need to be aware of this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a recent upgrade, cPanel has started to ignore any code inside a core/ directory when doing backups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this means that your app/code/core folder will not be backed up - of course this is the most crucial folder in your Magento installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you are not editing core files anyway, so ultimately you shoudl be able to redownload your Magento version and extract the app/code/core folder from there, but even so, this is an extra step that you might need to take which will slow down your recovery in case of a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See this Magento forum thread for more details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/210785/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/210785/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Migrating osCommerce Sites to a New Server (also CRE Loaded, Zen Cart etc)</title>
      <link>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/oscommerce/migrating-oscommerce-sites-to-a-new-server-also-cre-loaded-zen-cart-etc.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2009 11:27:32 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://edmondscommerce.github.io/oscommerce/migrating-oscommerce-sites-to-a-new-server-also-cre-loaded-zen-cart-etc.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;oldpost&#34;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;This is post is now quite old and the the information it contains may be out of date or innacurate.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you find any errors or have any suggestions to update the information &lt;a href=&#34;http://edmondscommerce.github.io/contact-us/index.html&#34;&gt;please let us know&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/edmondscommerce/edmondscommerce.github.io&#34;&gt;create a pull request on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
If you need to move your osCommerce (and derivatives such as CRE Loaded and Zen Cart) based site to a new server, here is a quick explanation of our approach which enables you to handle the migration without any downtime and no loss of order or customer information despite the fact that in the propagation period, visitors may visit the new server or the old server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This propagation period is due to the fact that DNS servers around the globe may have cached your old DNS record, which points your domain name at your old IP address. These caches can stay alive for up to 48 hours meaning that you can not be certain that a visitor will definitely go to your new server within this period despite the fact that you have updated your domain name to point at your new name servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First - Copy the Files + Database:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course you need to copy all of the site files from the old server to the new server. The slowest and least reliable way to do this is via FTP. By using FTP, you have to actually download all the files on your old server to your local PC and then upload those files from your local PC to the new server. This can take a long time, especially the uploading part (thanks to the asynchronous nature of ADSL).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the database you need to create a dump file via the command line or exporting from phpMyAdmin. Like FTP for the files, if you use phpMyAdmin then you have to download the dump file to your local machine and then upload it to the new server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better method for moving the files and database dump is to use SCP to copy files directly from the old server to the new server. I have written an article explaining this technique here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/blog/hosting/basic-server-migration-using-ssh-scp/&#34;&gt;Basic Server Migration Using SSH + SCP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configuring the New Server&lt;/strong&gt;
Unfortunately osCommerce based sites often require register globals to be enabled. They also use the old fashioned long arrays. That means that you will probably need to edit the configuration of the new server to enable these old PHP features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an example vhost.conf (don&amp;rsquo;t forget to create the vhost_ssl.conf with the same settings) for Plesk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&amp;lt;Directory /var/www/vhosts/********.co.uk/httpdocs&amp;gt;
php_admin_value open_basedir /var/www/vhosts/******.co.uk/dbCreds:/var/www/vhosts/******.co.uk/httpdocs:/tmp
AllowOverride All
php_admin_flag register_globals on
php_admin_flag register_long_arrays on
&amp;lt;/Directory&amp;gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I have specified a non webaccessible folder called dbCreds which contains the database credentials. I can then simply include this file from within the includes/configure.php and admin/includes/configure.php files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensuring No Loss of Customer or Order Information&lt;/strong&gt;
To make sure that you don&amp;rsquo;t lose any customer or order information, we need to take a couple of extra steps. First though an explanation of what can go wrong:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the propagation period, there is a distinct possibility that you will be taking orders on both servers. If you don&amp;rsquo;t take any extra steps, then you might have orders and customers on both servers that have the same id number on the database. This can then make transferring the missing orders from the old server to the new server problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple solution is to simply edit the autoincrement value on the orders and the customers table. I would normally suggest using a big jump in increment like 1000. This will mean that new orders and customers created on the new server will have id numbers that are 1000 higher than the old server. By doing this, we can then import any missing order and customer information over, safe in the knowledge that the id numbers will not clash. Of course, if you expect to create 1000 orders or customers within a couple of days then you will need to make a bigger increment increase on the new server. You are probably also turning over vast amounts of cash :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the propagation period is over, lets say 3 days after you update your name servers, you can use this little script I created to help you to export the missing orders from your old server to your new server&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/5958&#34;&gt;Server Migration Orders / Customers Synchronisation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Someone To Handle it For You&lt;/strong&gt;
Of course, if you prefer you can book someone to handle the migration for you. If you would like us to take care of your migration, just &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/contact-about-oscommerce-server-migration.html&#34;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
