      <description>&lt;h2&gt;What DNS is&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNS (Domain Name System)&lt;/strong&gt; is the system used to make sure that when users type in your web address into their browser, they end up on your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How communication happens on the internet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using the web, every site has its own address. It might have extra bits on the start and end, but the core part will be &amp;ldquo;yoursitename.com&amp;rdquo;, or similar. This is your &lt;strong&gt;Domain Name&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, servers have a unique number assigned to them, similar to how houses have phone numbers. This will look something like &amp;ldquo;123.456.789.000&amp;rdquo;. This is called an &lt;strong&gt;IP Address&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like phone numbers, the problem with IP addresses is that they&amp;rsquo;re hard to remember. It&amp;rsquo;s not easy to tell other people a list of numbers and have them remember them when they get home. It&amp;rsquo;s for this reason we have phone books. Fortunately the internet has its own built in way of looking up IP addresses by a name. This is where DNS comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DNS is a way of looking up an IP address by a more memorable name. When you type in &amp;ldquo;google.com&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s actually being converted into an IP address without you realising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How Domain Names are converted into IP Addresses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you buy your domain from your registrar, you will also be provided an area where you can set up &lt;strong&gt;DNS Records, also called Zone Records&lt;/strong&gt;. This is where you, or your development company, set up the conversion from the Domain Name to the IP address. When this is populated, people accessing your domain are able to end up on your server because of this translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In actual fact, this information is spread across the world so that every &lt;strong&gt;DNS Server&lt;/strong&gt; in the world (a place where the translation happens) knows what your IP address is, exactly like sharing a phone book with the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This translation information is transmitted with a validity period, which is how often other DNS Servers should ask for updates. This is called a &amp;ldquo;Time To Live&amp;rdquo;, or TTL). This is generally set to a relatively high time, and is the reason you generally have a 24 hour wait period when you change where your site is hosted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Separating your Domain Registrar from your Name Server&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s possible (and not unusual) to have the &lt;strong&gt;Domain Registrar&lt;/strong&gt; (the company you bought the domain from) and the &lt;strong&gt;Name Server&lt;/strong&gt; (the place where you update these DNS records) in completely different places. This is set up by telling your Registrar where your Name Servers are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When this is changed, it means that the Registrar is no longer in control of the translation from Domain Name to IP Address&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The General Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when you access a website, here is what&amp;rsquo;s actually happening behind the scenes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You type in the web address into your browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your browser asks a DNS Server what the corresponding IP address is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DNS server sends the IP address back to your computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your browser then knows which specific IP address to send subsequent messages to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The browser takes this IP adress and sends a message to the server it&#39;s assigned to for the web page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The server sends back the page to your computer, and it&#39;s displayed on your screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>osCommerce PHP 5.2 Upgrade - You Really Should Get onto PHP 5.3 ASAP</title>
      <link>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/oscommerce/oscommerce-php-5-2-upgrade-you-really-should-get-onto-php-5-3-asap.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2012 17:36:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/oscommerce/oscommerce-php-5-2-upgrade-you-really-should-get-onto-php-5-3-asap.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many of our clients use &lt;a href=&#34;https://edmondscommerce.github.io/platforms/oscommerce&#34;&gt;osCommerce&lt;/a&gt; for their online store. osCommerce was very popular a few years ago and to date still powers a really large number of stores. Due to a variety of technical reasons, many osCommerce stores are still hosting on PHP version 5.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest version of PHP is 5.4 and 5.5 is due out fairly soon. Most hosting companies will now regard PHP 5.3 to be the minimum version they will support. By switching to PHP 5.3 they get better performance and better security. Unfortunately if you are running an osCommerce store and your hosting company decides to upgrade PHP then you might find that your entire store stops working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first instinct here is to get your store back online as quickly as possible and that is entirely understandable. These days though we really think that osCommerce store owners should be running on PHP 5.3. It is entirely possible to do this and does not necessarily entail a large amount of work depending on which contributions you are running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last release for PHP 5.2 was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.php.net/archive/2010.php#id2010-12-16-1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;version 5.2.16 released back in 2010&lt;/a&gt;. In software terms that is really quite a long time ago and really underlines how much of an issue this is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read about some of the performance gains of switching to PHP 5.3 or greater on &lt;a href=&#34;http://php.net/manual/en/features.gc.performance-considerations.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like some help getting your osCommerce store working on an up to date version of PHP then &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://edmondscommerce.github.io/contact-us&#34;&gt;get in touch with Edmonds Commerce today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course another option is to think about moving away from osCommerce and onto a more up to date platform such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://edmondscommerce.github.io/platforms/oscommerce&#34;&gt;osCommerce&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://edmondscommerce.github.io/platforms/opencart&#34;&gt;OpenCart&lt;/a&gt;. If you are thinking of ugprading then 5.3 compatability will be a bonus. If you are not thinking of upgrading platform any time soon though you really do need to schedule in an upgrade to PHP 5.3 at the earliest opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Live Images on Staging Without Absolute URLs (but a bit of JS)</title>
      <link>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/javascript/using-live-images-on-staging-without-absolute-urls-but-a-bit-of-js.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2012 11:05:49 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/javascript/using-live-images-on-staging-without-absolute-urls-but-a-bit-of-js.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have a staging copy of your site anywhere then you might not bother copying over your entire catalogue of product images etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might decide to drop in absolute URLs for those images so that they are pulled from live. However you really don&amp;rsquo;t want absolute URLs in your code and you certainly don&amp;rsquo;t want that to go live because it just adds unnecessary bloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice trick you can do here is make a change to your staging site as follows. Of course ensure this change doesn&amp;rsquo;t go live, but it should be just one file so that&amp;rsquo;s easy to handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note this assumes you already have jQuery available on your page)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;text/javascript&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;ready&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;img&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;each&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;attr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;src&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;        
        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;indexOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;http&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)){&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;new_src&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;http://www.LIVEDOMAIN.co.uk/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;attr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;src&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;new_src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to change LIVEDOMAIN to be your real live domain&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Extract Files from Plesk Backups</title>
      <link>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/plesk/how-to-extract-files-from-plesk-backups.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2012 17:25:16 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/plesk/how-to-extract-files-from-plesk-backups.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So you have a plesk backup file and you want to extract and open the files from it? No problem. This blog will show you how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file is a mime file. The &amp;ldquo;mpack&amp;rdquo; package will let you unpack it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we install the &amp;ldquo;mpack&amp;rdquo; package&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install mpack
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine your file is called &amp;ldquo;pleskDump.gz&amp;rdquo;. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a &amp;ldquo;.gz&amp;rdquo; at the end it might not be bad to add it as some environments will complain if it&amp;rsquo;s absent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we unzip the file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gunzip pleskDump.gz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s un-mime the file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir pleskDumpOutput
cd pleskDumpOutput
cat ../pleskDump | munpack
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have a bunch of regular tar files, but be careful, if we just extract them, the root folders will not be recreated. In order to keep things together, it&amp;rsquo;s best now to look at the output you have. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a made up example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;example-domain.com.httpdocs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the format is essentially domain.rootfolder or in another way, the tar files have your domain name they are archiving, then a dot, then the name of the root folder they made up. We take that root folder and create it like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir rootfolder
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s apply that idea to our previoud example; &amp;ldquo;example-domain.com&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir httpdocs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to untar into the folder you just created, let&amp;rsquo;s assume you just created &amp;ldquo;httpdocs&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;tar -xvf example-domain.com.httpdocs -C httpdocs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you go! You can now output any of the folders you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simple way to check Magento email setup</title>
      <link>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/simple-way-to-check-magento-email-setup.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2011 15:58:30 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/simple-way-to-check-magento-email-setup.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, you&amp;rsquo;ve just moved a magento setup from one host to another, and you want to check if the email setup is correct, how do you do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple easy way to do this is to have a test front-end user (which you probably already have) and send a password change email to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple trick but a good timesaver.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magento admin backend slow (quick speed tip)</title>
      <link>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-admin-backend-slow-quick-speed-tip.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2011 12:48:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-admin-backend-slow-quick-speed-tip.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that can catch you out if you have a paranoid server admin is that various magento extensions will contact external servers (such as SagePay or Mailchimp).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the server admin has blocked outbound web traffic (to avoid DDoS attacks and other malicious traffic), these extensions will slow you down at every step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple answer, if you&amp;rsquo;re running magento, ensure you have outbound traffic enabled.  Also, don&amp;rsquo;t assume that just because you can use lynx, apt-get et al at the command prompt that you can as the web server user.  IPTables and pf both have checks for outbound user, so be sure to test as www-user or apache.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Starting an Ecommerce Business,  in a Nutshell</title>
      <link>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/ecommerce/starting-an-ecommerce-business-in-a-nutshell.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2011 16:19:59 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/ecommerce/starting-an-ecommerce-business-in-a-nutshell.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;oldpost&#34;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;This is post is now quite old and the the information it contains may be out of date or innacurate.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you find any errors or have any suggestions to update the information &lt;a href=&#34;http://edmondscommerce.github.io/contact-us/index.html&#34;&gt;please let us know&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/edmondscommerce/edmondscommerce.github.io&#34;&gt;create a pull request on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
It may be obvious but after a discussion in the office we decided to put together a simple guideline for getting into e-commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a list of things that you need to do in order to start selling from your own web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get a Domain Name&lt;/b&gt;
These are so cheap yet so fundamentally important it really should be one of the first things you do. Always ensure you can get the .com even if you intend to run from the .co.uk. If budget allows, buy all the top level domains you can afford simply to ensure they are yours - eg .com, .net, .co.uk, .org.uk, .info etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Find a Supplier&lt;/b&gt;
The first thing you need is a supplier that you can buy from cheap enough to markup and earn a reasonable profit. Often this is one of the hardest bits, especially when you are starting out, finding a supplier that will agree to supply you can be tough. Be prepared to pay for stock up front initially and also to take on stock holdings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You May need Retail Shop&lt;/b&gt;
Even though you intend to make ecommerce the primary focus of your business, you may find some suppliers simply will not work with you if you do not have a retail shop. You need to double check this. Some times it is enough to have a few counters or a display rack in your warehouse, or some kind of &amp;ldquo;trade counter&amp;rdquo;. Other times you may really need a plate glass high street store front to get supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decide on your Fulfillment&lt;/b&gt;
You need to decide how you are going to fulfill customer orders. Are you going to do everything yourself? Are you going to use a fulfilment company to take care of this for you. You may find that your supplier(s) offer a drop shipping service where they will fulfill orders directly for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decide on Shipping Methods and Charges&lt;/b&gt;
Are you going to offer next day courier? Do you need to worry about insurance? Can you get away with Royal Mail? There are lots of things to consider when thinking about this aspect of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Merchant Account&lt;/b&gt;
If you want to take credit card payments, and any serious ecommerce business should - I definitely believe it is not enough to simply offer paypal - then you are going to need a merchant account. You will also need a business account - these do not have to be from the same bank, though they would have you believe they do. Shop around for the best rates - this can have a distinct impact on your bottom line, especially if margins are tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Payment Service Provider&lt;/b&gt;
The payment service provider is the system that will actually allow customers to enter card details and will report transactions back to your merchant account. Again its worth shopping around for the best rates. Bear in mind you can only have one PSP per merchant account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Choose your Shopping Cart Platform&lt;/b&gt;
You need to choose which platform you want to base the site on. Choices generally include Magento which is without a doubt the most popular and powerful, Open Cart, osCommerce and derivatives are still popular though not really for new sites these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get a Design&lt;/b&gt;
Your choices for design range from using an off the shelf theme which is the cheapest option through to getting a full custom design created. If you are looking for templates, simply search google for {platform} template or {platform} theme. For example &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.co.uk/search?gcx=c&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;channel=cs&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=magento+templates&#34;&gt;Magento Templates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Implement your design on your Cart&lt;/b&gt;
If you have chosen a template then this is usually a case of installing that template and then making whatever customisations you want/need to make in order to brand the site with your logos, colour schemes etc. If you have chosen to go for a custom design then this is a much larger task but the end result is something that is exactly what you want. This is definitely something that Edmonds Commerce can help you with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Load your Product Data&lt;/b&gt;
You need to populate your store with product information. In its barest form this should include name, description, SKU, price and images. You may find getting the data is tricky. Alternatively you may be lucky enough to have suppliers that offer a full data feed and images for their products making this very easy. If you need to bridge the gap, getting a custom scraper built to get product data from your suppliers web sites can be a very cost effective solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Choose a Hosting Company&lt;/b&gt;
Whilst your store is in development you will not generally need hosting. All of our client work is carried out on our local environment and staging server. It is only when the site is ready to go live that hosting is required. When choosing a host there is lots to consider. The first and most obvious is the hardware spec of your server. Are you going to go for the cheapest shared hosting, a VPS with reasonable power or a dedicated with large RAM and CPU resources?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other big question that I think a lot of people do not consider in enough detail is the level of support you need from your hosting company. This has a dramatic impact on the price. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to get a very powerful dedicated for around the £100 per month mark. However don&amp;rsquo;t bother calling the support line at 2am on a Saturday Morning. If you need full phone support, especially 24/7 then expect to pay for this. I would also advise trying to ring the support lines at these kinds of times just to check that it really is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Launch Your Store&lt;/b&gt;
You can launch your store as soon as you have product data and a means of payment set up and the store is accessible by visiting your domain name. There are different schools of thought on when you should launch. One is that you should not launch until your site is 100% finished and ready to impress your visitors with its sheer amazingness. Another school of thought is that you should launch ASAP to allow search engine spiders to get in and also to allow visitors to start trickling in allowing you to ensure your systems are all working properly before you switch on the more powerful marketing that will drive large traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Register Self Employed&lt;/b&gt;
If you are starting out in business you need to remember to register yourself as self employed with the revenue. Here is some more &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/selfemployed/register-selfemp.htm&#34;&gt;info&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unleash the Marketing&lt;/b&gt;
Your store will not succeed unless you have an effective marketing strategy in place. This could involve simply SEO + PPC or might extend through to TV adverts, billboards etc. The main differentiator is scale and budget. SEO is a long term strategy, it is unlikley you will achieve great results from the get go. PPC offers an instant response though the costs can be very high so maintaining profitability can be a concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Continuous Improvement&lt;/b&gt;
Once your ecommerce business is up and running you should commit yourself to a continuous cycle of improvement. It&amp;rsquo;s the only way to ensure you stay ahead of the game and achieve the level of progress you desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to plan on the fact that you will need to periodically upgrade your shopping cart. Especially if you are using Magento - it is being updated all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magento Hosting Optimisation Tips</title>
      <link>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-hosting-optimisation-tips.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2011 17:23:44 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-hosting-optimisation-tips.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to gain the most out of your Magento hosting and to optimise your Magento hosting stack, here are a few top tips that you can try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Ensure Caching is Enabled&lt;/b&gt;
It may sound obvious, but if you do not have caching enabled then the performance of your Magento store is going to suffer massively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally whilst developing, caching will need to be at least partially disabled to ensure that changes are reflected. Unfortunately some times when a site goes live, enabling caching is a forgotten step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Upgrade your Magento&lt;/b&gt;
More recent versions of Magento offer much better performance than earlier versions. If you are running a Magento version older than 1.4 then you should definitely look to upgrade as soon as possible as there are vast improvements to be made in terms of performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Disable or Improve Bad Extensions&lt;/b&gt;
Some custom modules or forum inspired template hacks can be functionally fine but absolutely terrible in terms of performance. Fancy a best sellers list? Lets calculate the top ten products on every single page load and display the results in the right hand column!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Use Block Caching&lt;/b&gt;
In order to deal with the above scenario, it is fairly easy to use block caching - something built into Magento as standard - to cache the html output of a block and serve from the cache rather than doing lots of heavy processing on an unnecessarily regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Move Hosts&lt;/b&gt;
Some times you just have to accept  that your hardware or hosting is no up to scratch. A well optimised LAMP stack can out perform an unoptimised standard stack by a surprising degree. Combine that with some choice extensions such as opcode caching etc and the performance difference can be really quite significant - and without any hardware upgrades. If you are running a VPS or dedicated server then it is possible to optimise the stack yourselves, or hire an agency like us to help you with this. Alternatively you can try to move hosts to a more specialist Magento hosting company that will provide this service as standard.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magento Optimised Hosting</title>
      <link>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-optimised-hosting.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2011 07:17:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-optimised-hosting.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Edmonds Commerce have been with Magento since the beginning. If you would like us to optimise your VPS or dedicated server for Magento then please &lt;a href=&#34;https://edmondscommerce.github.io/contact-us/&#34;&gt;get in touch today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back then the speed of Magento was one of its main drawbacks. Since that time, the code has improved a lot and things have generally got a lot better but one thing that has become clear over the years is that Magento really does require a well optimised hosting platform to perform the best. Conversely, hosting Magento on a badly configured or none optimised hosting stack will have a really detrimental effect on the performance of the store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using shared hosting then you are a bit stuck. Magento optimised shared hosting is available and there are some good companies out there that we would be happy to recommend for you. If your current store is not performing well though and you are on shared hosting then the likelihood is that the only solution is to either upgrade to some kind of dedicated or virtual private server, commonly shortened to VPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A VPS or VDS as they are some times called is what is known as a virtual machine. It is a full instance of an operating system (Linux) running on hardware that is actually running multiple virtual machines from one real server. In some respects this is like shared hosting, however the difference is that on a VPS you have a fully dedicated, private and customisable operating system that can be configured and optimised as required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course if you have a real dedicated server then you have the same benefits of a VPS and also enjoy dedicated hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, as soon as you have a dedicated operating system you are free to configure your database, web server and PHP however you wish. Generally though this is too technical for most people. This is where we come in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are happy to provide for you a full VPS or dedicated server Magento optimisation service. Our Magento hosting optimisation service will ensure you are getting the best out of your current hosting package. It means that you are not required to move hosts if you are generally happy them, but you can be assured that you are running on a highly optimised Magento stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that sounds interesting and you would like to discuss this in more detail, simply &lt;a href=&#34;https://edmondscommerce.github.io/contact-us/&#34;&gt;get in touch today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MySQL Got Error 28 From Storage Engine &#43; Solution</title>
      <link>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/linux/mysql-got-error-28-from-storage-engine-solution.html</link>

      <guid>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/linux/mysql-got-error-28-from-storage-engine-solution.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;oldpost&#34;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;This is post is now quite old and the the information it contains may be out of date or innacurate.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you find any errors or have any suggestions to update the information &lt;a href=&#34;http://edmondscommerce.github.io/contact-us/index.html&#34;&gt;please let us know&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/edmondscommerce/edmondscommerce.github.io&#34;&gt;create a pull request on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
If you get the error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Got error 28 from storage engine query&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are trying to access your web site, database or phpMyAdmin then the problem is likely to be that you have run out of hard disk space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have command line access you can quickly check this by running&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
df -h

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do see a partition with low or no space then the solution is simply to find and remove files that are not required and you should be back up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magento Hosting Check Script - Also Checking for Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-hosting-check-script-also-checking-for-optimisation.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2010 17:58:24 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-hosting-check-script-also-checking-for-optimisation.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To try to help clients who are choosing a hosting platform for Magento, we have modified the already available Magento Check script and extended it to also check for optimisation and some other key requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you can see the script here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&#34;text/javascript&#34; src=&#34;http://snipt.net/embed/cf6ca04739bafcd4834dc1b7bfd9b838&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m using a snipt rather than pasting the code directly in so that if we update it in future, this post should always contain the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magento cPanel Backup Issue - Not Backing up the Core Folder &#43; Solution</title>
      <link>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-cpanel-backup-issue-not-backing-up-the-core-folder-solution.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2010 13:06:28 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/magento-cpanel-backup-issue-not-backing-up-the-core-folder-solution.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are hosting a Magento site on cPanel powered hosting and are relying on the cPanel backup system to manage backing up your files then you need to be aware of this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a recent upgrade, cPanel has started to ignore any code inside a core/ directory when doing backups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this means that your app/code/core folder will not be backed up - of course this is the most crucial folder in your Magento installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you are not editing core files anyway, so ultimately you shoudl be able to redownload your Magento version and extract the app/code/core folder from there, but even so, this is an extra step that you might need to take which will slow down your recovery in case of a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See this Magento forum thread for more details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/210785/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/210785/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
