      <title>Play.com to Go Marketplace Only - Abandoning Retail Completely</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most online merchants who are into multichannel selling (that&amp;rsquo;s all of you, right?) must have heard of Play.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never quite up there with Amazon and Ebay it was often the one that merchants asked us to integrate with once the two big ones were taken care of. Play was originally a pure online retailer but decided a few years ago to jump on the marketplace bandwagon like market leaders Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it seems Play have been bought out by a Japanese company and thanks to a lucrative VAT loophole being closed (and rightly so) they have now decided to abandon retail sales completely and concentrate purely on their marketplace business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read more about it here:

&lt;p&gt;And it might be worth checking out their current clearance for particularly good offers as well from a punters point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>#PHPNW12 Round UP</title>
      <link>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/php/phpnw12-round-up.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Oct 2012 11:30:43 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/php/phpnw12-round-up.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;All of the PHP developers from Edmonds Commerce made our annual pilgramage over the Pennines to Manchester this weekend to visit arguably one of the best PHP conferences around - PHP North West, PHPNW for short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a three track conference with a diverse range of expert PHP developers giving presentations on some really interesting topics. The team split up and chose their own route through the choice of talks meaning that between us all we got a real flavour of the entire conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They Keynote by Ade Oshineye was all to do with API development and DevX - developer experience as opposed to the more usual and in vogue UX - user experience. The point being that users are often getting a lot of thought put into their experiences but developers are often given sparsely documented and unwieldy APIs to work with. The metaphor of a door with an ambiguous push/pull requirement was really apt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particular highlights for me included the &lt;a href=&#34;http://nodephp.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ReactPHP&lt;/a&gt; talk by Igor Wiedler which was both entertaining and really informative. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zeromq.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ØMQ (zero MQ)&lt;/a&gt; layer looks really interesting among other things. The guys that went to the Data structures talk by Patrick Allaert were really impressed with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take homes from the conference in terms of projects and technologies to keep an eye on include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://getcomposer.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Composer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://silex.sensiolabs.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Silex Framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://nodephp.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;React PHP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zeromq.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ØMQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://aws.amazon.com/code/6752709412171743&#34;&gt;Amazon Web Services Command Line Tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CentOS &#43; Sun Java &#43; Amazon AMTU 2</title>
      <link>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/amazon/centos-sun-java-amazon-amtu-2.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Aug 2012 17:33:31 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/amazon/centos-sun-java-amazon-amtu-2.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a follow up to our popular blog post describing the process of getting AMTU 1 set up on a Centos server, this post describes how to get the latest version 2 of AMTU running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things have moved on and thankfully it is a lot easier than it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly get Sun Java installed. You will need to get the URL for downloading the RPM from here:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1637588.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1637588.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accept the agreement, download the correct RPM version and then pause it. Copy the download URL and paste it into this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /tmp
wget &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;paste-url&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;-here&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
rpm - jre &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;hit tab to complete&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now check the correct java version is being used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;java -version
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should get something looking like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
[root@94 tmp]# java -version
java version &amp;amp;quot;1.7.0_05&amp;amp;quot;
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_05-b06)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.1-b03, mixed mode)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can install AMTU&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;wget https://d28hcfptedr5ia.cloudfront.net/install/AMTU_unix.sh
chmod +x AMTU_unix.sh
./AMTU_unix.sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep hitting enter to get to the bottom of the terms and then agree, agree to all the other options. That is AMTU installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step is to configure this using the CLI configure utitlity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to create an xml file for the AMTU configuration. You can see a sample file in /opt/amtu/xml/sample.xml.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets copy that file and then edit it accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /opt/amtu/xml
cp sample.xml configuration.xml
vim configuration.xml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do need to be signed up for MWS to get some of the keys etc that are required. If not already, go to this page and hit the sign up button.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.amazonservices.co.uk/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://developer.amazonservices.co.uk/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have updated the XML configuration you run this command to apply it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/opt/amtu/Utilities/configure SETUP /opt/amtu/xml/configuration.xml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get some error messages at this point, edit the configuration and try again. Once you have the configuration set you can start the daemon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/opt/AMTU/Utilities/amtu_daemon start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Amazon Web Services Blog: AWS Elastic Beanstalk - Build PHP Apps Using Git-Based Deployment</title>
      <link>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/hosting/amazon-web-services-blog-aws-elastic-beanstalk-build-php-apps-using-git-based-deployment.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Easily deploy PHP applications to the Amazon Web Services infrastructure allowing you to take advantage of an easily scaled flexible cloud based system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore there is Git based deployment so your version control workflow can hook directly into deployment for speed and convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does really look attractive. The Angry birds store recently launched on Magento using Varnish and Amazon Web Services and it runs very fast indeed. Perhaps the days of expensive dedicated hardware are really numbered. If its this easy to set something up that can perform as well as a complex server cluster at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AMTU Not Recognizing Files &#43; Solution</title>
      <link>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/linux/amtu-not-recognizing-files-solution.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Aug 2011 18:30:17 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/linux/amtu-not-recognizing-files-solution.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;oldpost&#34;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;This is post is now quite old and the the information it contains may be out of date or innacurate.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you find any errors or have any suggestions to update the information &lt;a href=&#34;http://edmondscommerce.github.io/contact-us/index.html&#34;&gt;please let us know&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/edmondscommerce/edmondscommerce.github.io&#34;&gt;create a pull request on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve recently had to upgrade a shop that lists products on amazon. They wanted to automatically add new products and keep their inventory up to date, so I set up a feed generating system and installed AMTU to send the data through to amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After putting together a test run I saw that the Inventory Uploader was being sent to to the failed folder. The only clue about this was in the audit logs where it said
&lt;code&gt;
2011-08-03 16:02:20,062 INFO  Could not recognize file amazon_amtu_price_quantity.txt - ignoring.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a lot of looking around, it appears that AMTU require the top line on the feeds that starts TemplateType=&amp;hellip; If this is missing the system flags the file as unknown, and refuses to send it. To make things worse, trying to get round this by using a different template type causes amazon to reject the file on their end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this I started to look online to find a solution. Everything that I could find referenced the 1.0.9 AMTU version that I was using, and it was only by accident that I discovered that Amazon had quietly released an update to the program earlier this year. This new, AMTU 2.0, accepts all of the new file types, offers more intergration with the fulfilment by amazon service and is simple to install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So others don&amp;rsquo;t have to spend as much time as I did, this is what you need to do to install it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop and uninstall your previous version of AMTU. To do this you need to ensure that the JAVA_HOME variable is set in bash. To check this type
&lt;code&gt;
echo $JAVA_HOME
&lt;/code&gt;
If something is displayed, then the variable is set, if not then you will need to set it. Find where your java home directory is, mine was in /usr/java/latest/, if yours is not there type the following
&lt;code&gt;
find / -name java 2&amp;gt;/dev/null
&lt;/code&gt;
This will give you a list of directories, you&amp;rsquo;re looking for one that a /bin folder inside it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have the directory, you need to set the variable. The best way is to edit /root/.bash_profile and add in the following line
&lt;code&gt;
export JAVA_HOME=&amp;ldquo;/path/to/dir/&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/code&gt;
However this require you to log out, or restart the server. If this isn&amp;rsquo;t possible, type the same line on the command line and it will set the variable for the rest of the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once everything is set up, go to your AMTU folder, /opt/amtu/ in my case, and run the uninstall.sh script. This will remove amtu, but leave the files you&amp;rsquo;ve already generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next download the appropriate version from this &lt;a href=&#34;https://sellercentral.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/help-page.html/ref=ag_16481_cont_32911?isLink=1&amp;itemID=16481&#34;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;, or if setting up on a server use the following code
&lt;code&gt;wget &lt;a href=&#34;https://d28hcfptedr5ia.cloudfront.net/install/AMTU_unix.sh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://d28hcfptedr5ia.cloudfront.net/install/AMTU_unix.sh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;make sure the file is executable and then run it. Fill in the information that is asked for and you&amp;rsquo;re good to go. When you set it up, you&amp;rsquo;ll be asked for your MWS details. If you are running the installation on a desktop, then it will provide you with a link that you can click and register. Once you have set everything up, you can export your settings, by running the following command
&lt;code&gt;
/path/to/amtu/Utilities/configure EXPORT /tmp/config.xml
&lt;/code&gt;
you can then move the config file onto the server and run import the file, using SETUP instead of EXPORT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once all of this is done, your system is ready to go. I hope this will save someone some time&lt;/p&gt;
