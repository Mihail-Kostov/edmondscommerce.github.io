      <description>&lt;p&gt;If Chrome is displaying mix content errors this means that Chrome thinks that some of the resources on the page where loaded over HTTP rather than HTTPS. But one behaviour of Chrome that might catch you out is that if Chrome at any point on a domain encountered a page with mixed content, it will then treat the whole site as having mixed content even if a given single page does not have mixed content. Chrome is unlikely to tell you this is the reason a single page has mixed content, the best way to tell is to keep closing chrome, starting a new session and browse until you get mixed content.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Got the Insecure Content on a Secure HTTPs Page Problem - Easy Solution</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Often you will see SSL warnings or errors related to insecure content being displayed on a secure page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be as simple as one javascript file or image that is being included via http rather than https, though some times this can be a bit tricky to track down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest solution is to hit this site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.whynopadlock.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.whynopadlock.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will give you a clear report of the problems and should help you quickly find and fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively if you use Chrome you may see the details in the Javascript console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you know what elements are being called by http as opposed to https, you simply need to make them use https or remove them altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
