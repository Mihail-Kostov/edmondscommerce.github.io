      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are running an E-Commerce store then you&amp;rsquo;ve probably received various offers to improve the online shopping experience, optimize conversion rate and so on. All these offers are a part of a user experience. For example - if you receive an offer to improve your online store&amp;rsquo;s shopping experience then most likely the service provider will go thorough the sales funnel, get some valuable input by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/conversion-rate-optimization/using-advanced-analytics-to-improve-conversion-rates/&#34; title=&#34;Using Advanced Analytics to Improve Conversion Rates&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;setting up and analysing your website metrics&lt;/a&gt;, conduct a user survey by online forms and ask directly to the customers via email or even give them a private call.
All of the above is necessary to really understand how your users (customers) interact with your site, how:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;valuable&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;findable&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;usable&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;desirable&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;accessible&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;credible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;they found your site or offer to be. As for those who need a definition - &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience&#34; title=&#34;User Experience - Wikipedia&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s what wikipedia says about user experience&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;em&gt;User experience (UX) involves a person&amp;rsquo;s emotions about using a particular product, system or service. User experience highlights the experiential, affective, meaningful and valuable aspects of human-computer interaction and product ownership. Additionally, it includes a person’s perceptions of the practical aspects such as utility, ease of use and efficiency of the system. User experience is subjective in nature because it is about individual perception and thought with respect to the system. User experience is dynamic as it is constantly modified over time due to changing circumstances and new innovations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So, what elements the user experience should contain?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Valuable&lt;/h3&gt;
The solution must deliver measurable value for site owners or interested group. It can be conversions, leads, subscriptions, etc.
&lt;h3&gt;Findable&lt;/h3&gt;
Make it easy to find what your target audience is looking for, not only by optimizing search engines but focusing on internal navigation
&lt;h3&gt;Usable&lt;/h3&gt;
Ease of use is extremely important; it must be intuitive and fluid. You need to create a funnel that leads your audience to your goal effectively
&lt;h3&gt;Desirable&lt;/h3&gt;
Your target audience must have a strong desire to use your solution whether it’s for content, experience or emotions
&lt;h3&gt;Accessible&lt;/h3&gt;
The solution must be easily accessible for your target audience – whether it’s technological requirements or people with disabilities
&lt;h3&gt;Credible&lt;/h3&gt;
Your solution must be credible by all means. It has to build trust in your particular target audience by including important credibility factors
&lt;h2&gt;What’s In It For You?&lt;/h2&gt;
The benefits are pretty obvious. In this stage we help you to identify your market and learn about your target audience behavior and needs as much as possible. These real world insights are extremely valuable and perform a key role in a project life-cycle. In short – careful planning allows you to focus on most beneficial features first and drive more revenue with minimum effort.
&lt;h2&gt;Why Plan?&lt;/h2&gt;
When embarking on a project to launch or relaunch an e-commerce web site it can seem like a daunting and overwhelming prospect. The danger is that without &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/web-project-management/guidelines-of-effective-web-project-workflow/&#34; title=&#34;Guidelines of Effective Web Project Management&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;proper planning and project management&lt;/a&gt;, the final outcome can be much less effective and efficient than if proper planning and preliminary research is used to define clear goals and then ensure these are met

      <title>Sales Reporting Zero for Second Store in Magento</title>
      <link>https://edmondscommerce.github.io/magento/sales-reporting-zero-for-second-store-in-magento.html</link>

If you are running multi site Magento with different currencies and are finding that the sales reports on the stores that don&amp;rsquo;t use the Magento default currency all show zero this probably means the currency conversion rates have not been configured. Due to the way Magento orders work existing orders will not have there conversion rate updated. There is no way to do this from the admin, the only real option is to update the orders directly in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
