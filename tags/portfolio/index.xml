&lt;h2&gt;Magento Site Upgrade&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Mayhew Ltd. required their Magento site to be upgraded from Enterprise 1.7 to the current release. They are looking to do this because the current site is having problems with some of the functionality which can only be correct by upgrading an extension and the extensions latest version is not compatibility with 1.7. 1.7 is also preventing them from improving the site and adding functionality. This mainly involved updating their site templates to function correctly the the new release as well as resolving issues related to old/new extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Kevin Mayhew&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Mayhew is a Christian religious product and music retailer, Christian church resource supplier and Christian book publisher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project went really well with the pushing to live been successful. With the site now running the latest version of Magento the company can look forward toward to expanding the functionality of the site as well as resolving issues the old site was having.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Client Site Redesign Implemented - Looks Great</title>

I have just finished a project for a client specialising in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ballicom.co.uk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Computers and Peripherals&lt;/a&gt; to take their osCommerce based site (though heavily customised) and apply a fresh new design to the existing site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the design work I have hooked up with local web designers &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.creode.co.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Creode&lt;/a&gt; who are actually based in the same office complex as Edmonds Commerce making colaboration a breeze. I have been impressed with the quality of their work and will definitely be hooking up with them for future projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edmonds Commerce&amp;rsquo;s role in the project was to take the design ideas of Creode and apply them to the existing osCommerce system with the minimum of fuss. We have also added in a few extra nice features such as a popular searches system on sub category pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will shortly be upgrading the site with a streamlined fast checkout procedure as well which will be the icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;
