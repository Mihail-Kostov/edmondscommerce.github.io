Edmonds Commerce is very pleased to announce the launch of our new &lt;b&gt;link building service&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any site that wishes to rank well in the search engines for competitive keywords needs to have a link building campaign as an important part of it&amp;rsquo;s SEO strategy. If you are looking to outsource your link building, it is important that you use a company with a deep understanding of SEO. We can offer this to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to take care choosing your link building service as there are numerous potential pitfalls and mistakes that can be made with a link building campaign and it is all too easy to waste your money on worthless or even counter productive link building strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is for this reason we have decided to launch our &lt;b&gt;link building service&lt;/b&gt;, offering you peace of mind based on the trust that we have built up as a web development company and with the quality and reliability that our development customers already enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in outsourcing your link building to Edmonds Commerce, simply &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/contact-about-link-building-service.html&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;drop us an email&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or alternatively give us a call on &lt;b&gt;0844 357 0201&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Involved?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will ask you for a monthly budget and will work with you to choose some keywords to target. We will then use this budget to build the maximum quantity and quality links possible for you, to the high standards we demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we ask from you as the client is simply a monthly commitment of a set budget to build these links. We strongly believe that a link building campaign should be consistent and permanent rather than a short sharp spike every now and then. For brand new sites there is an argument that an initial burst of link building can be beneficial, primarily to help get the site spidered, but in the longer term a steady stream of new inbound links is much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an initial budget we ask for a minimum of &lt;strong&gt;Â£100 per month&lt;/strong&gt;. Of course you can spend as much as you want, but its more important that is is sustainable so choose a price that is affordable. If that is a bit too much for you, we suggest you look into link building for yourself. Note we really emphasise that you must be able to sustain this price on a monthly basis for at least 6 months. We do not believe or advise in flash in the pan SEO campaigns and strongly suggest implementing a consistent and long term SEO strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Quickly Will it Benefit the Site?&lt;/b&gt;
SEO is a long term strategy with a delayed gratification. There are short cuts and possibilities to shoot to the top, but these techniques (often referred to as &amp;lsquo;black hat&amp;rsquo;) are not recommended if you are looking for something reliable and long term. How quickly the new links will start to benefit your site is hard to judge with precision and of course it depends on other factors such as the SEO of the actual site pages themselves and how competitive your particular keywords are. As a general idea though, we would expect to see benefits within a couple of months or so. That said, we are seeing nearly instant benefit to some of our clients who have established sites. It seems they just needed that little extra push for the search engines to really dig into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are there Other Thing&amp;rsquo;s My Site Needs for SEO?&lt;/b&gt;
Yes link building is only one aspect of a successful SEO campaign. More important than link building is ensuring that the site itself is optimised. This is already something that Edmonds Commerce offers as a service. This is kind of SEO comes under the umbrella term of &amp;lsquo;on site&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;on page&amp;rsquo; SEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important factor in SEO is having quality original and keyword rich textual content on your site. Writing search engine friendly text does not require any particular specialist or technical knowledge other than a broad understanding of the principles of SEO and of course a flair for writing helps! We will gladly advise you on how to go about writing optimised content and can give you some pointers on how to improve your content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would be interested in outsourcing your search engine optimised textual content creation do get in touch as we are considering adding this to our portfolio of services at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is Page Rank?&lt;/b&gt;
Often you will hear the term page rank (often abbreviated to PR). This refers to Google&amp;rsquo;s Page Rank system. This system gives each page on the internet that Google is aware of a score from 0 to 10. The best score is 10 and 0 is of course the lowest. There are some pages that Google is not even aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very roughly speaking, Google scores these pages in terms of how many links from other sites are linking to the specific page. If there are lots of other pages linking to this page, the page rank for this page will be higher. Also, PR is passed on. So if your page has lots of links from pages that have a high PR then its likely that your page will have a high PR. Conversely if all of the pages linking to your page have a PR of 0, or worse aren&amp;rsquo;t even known by Google at all, then your PR is likely to be low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why does PR Matter?&lt;/b&gt;
Generally speaking, if there are two pages about the same subject and they are both equal in terms of their &amp;lsquo;on site&amp;rsquo; SEO then the page with the higher page rank will rank higher in the search results than the page with lower page rank. That&amp;rsquo;s it basically, its a factor in determining which pages should be displayed higher in the results. It is by no means the only factor but it is definitely involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I Sign Up for the Link Building Service?&lt;/b&gt;

We are totally sure that after 3 months you will want to maintain the service as a permanent arrangement, steadily improving your search engine presence as a long term sustainable strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SEO Service Providers - What to Check For:</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;oldpost&#34;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;This is post is now quite old and the the information it contains may be out of date or innacurate.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Many organisations choose to outsource some or all of their SEO efforts. SEO is at once simple and also complicated. The basic principles are simple enough, but if you do things slightly wrong then you may inadvertantly do something which is actually counter productive to your SEO efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat spammy sites, search engines use various methods to check if a site is spammy or not. Unfortunately like any automated system there will always be false positives. What this means to you is that if you accidently do something which the search engines will regard as spammy, you might actually harm rather than help your search engine performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there are many organisations who market themselves as SEO professionals and offer SEO services, but will at best do you no good and at worst could actually trigger your site to be labelled as spammy by the search engines and get you penalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I received a well written email from a UK based company (I won&amp;rsquo;t name names) offering a link building service with a free 30 day trial. Why not is the first instinct - a free trial is worth having I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon ringing the company and speaking to one of their represenatives, I quickly determined that this company is not one that I would like to be handling any aspect of my SEO efforts. Here are the things that got me worried:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searching Google for the company name did not bring them up&lt;/strong&gt;
If nothing else, every web site should rank number one for its own name. I asked them about this and they told me that they do not want to rank in the search engines&amp;hellip;? An SEO company that doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to rank in the search engines&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Their website has a pagerank of 0 - a white bar in the Google Toolbar&lt;/strong&gt;
Many people will tell you these days that pagerank is not important. In general I agree, however having no pagerank at all is a particularly bad sign, especially considering the fact that link building is intended to build link popularity which is pretty much what pagerank is about. For a link building company that&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They were unwilling to offer any examples of sites that they have done SEO for&lt;/strong&gt;
They quoted privacy for this which is fair enough, however I am sure that a happy client would not have any complaints if their site was used to demonstrate the value of the SEO companies services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They only place links on their own network of sites&lt;/strong&gt;
This is where it starts to get really bad. The technique they use is widely acknowledged to be a spamming tactic which Google can detect and will penalise. Getting your link spread across this link farm will almost certainly get your site penalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A real link building company would search out sites that are &amp;ldquo;out there&amp;rdquo; on the internet that are in the same niche as your site and will try to get these sites to link back to your site. It&amp;rsquo;s an incredibly difficult and laborious task which is why so many people outsource it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have looked into loads of different companies that offer a link building service and have yet to find one that actually does what it says on the tin. I have seen companies that simply add your link to a bunch of link farms that they control (as in this case) which is at best totally useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also seen companies who charge high monthly rates for links on an ongoing basis. All these guys are doing is simply renting links for you. This is another tactic which Google is going after in a big way. The value of hired links is now questionable. There is no real need to use a middle man for this service as there are plenty of link renting sites set up that you can organise your own link rentals should you decide to go down this path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion any SEO tactic that requires ongoing payment to sustain is not real SEO. To me real SEO is like building a wall. Every action you do is another brick in the wall. Your wall gets bigger and stronger every day and with consistent effort you have built a nice solid house that brings consistent traffic with no ongoing investment.&lt;/p&gt;
