      <title>osCommerce PHP 5.2 Upgrade - You Really Should Get onto PHP 5.3 ASAP</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many of our clients use &lt;a href=&#34;http://example.com/platforms/oscommerce&#34;&gt;osCommerce&lt;/a&gt; for their online store. osCommerce was very popular a few years ago and to date still powers a really large number of stores. Due to a variety of technical reasons, many osCommerce stores are still hosting on PHP version 5.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest version of PHP is 5.4 and 5.5 is due out fairly soon. Most hosting companies will now regard PHP 5.3 to be the minimum version they will support. By switching to PHP 5.3 they get better performance and better security. Unfortunately if you are running an osCommerce store and your hosting company decides to upgrade PHP then you might find that your entire store stops working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first instinct here is to get your store back online as quickly as possible and that is entirely understandable. These days though we really think that osCommerce store owners should be running on PHP 5.3. It is entirely possible to do this and does not necessarily entail a large amount of work depending on which contributions you are running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last release for PHP 5.2 was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.php.net/archive/2010.php#id2010-12-16-1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;version 5.2.16 released back in 2010&lt;/a&gt;. In software terms that is really quite a long time ago and really underlines how much of an issue this is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read about some of the performance gains of switching to PHP 5.3 or greater on &lt;a href=&#34;http://php.net/manual/en/features.gc.performance-considerations.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like some help getting your osCommerce store working on an up to date version of PHP then &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://example.com/contact-us&#34;&gt;get in touch with Edmonds Commerce today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course another option is to think about moving away from osCommerce and onto a more up to date platform such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://example.com/platforms/oscommerce&#34;&gt;osCommerce&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://example.com/platforms/opencart&#34;&gt;OpenCart&lt;/a&gt;. If you are thinking of ugprading then 5.3 compatability will be a bonus. If you are not thinking of upgrading platform any time soon though you really do need to schedule in an upgrade to PHP 5.3 at the earliest opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magento 2 - Key Points for Developers!</title>
      <link>http://example.com/magento/magento-2-key-points-for-developers.html</link>

      <guid>http://example.com/magento/magento-2-key-points-for-developers.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first development release of Magento 2 has a few areas worthy of note for developers of the coming changes to Magento.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magento 2 now requires PHP 5.3
Zend is still version 1.11.1.
Magento 2 now implements templates on a per modules basis. So now all the different bits of the theme are separated into the modules it belongs to. This means that any existing version 1 theme cannot be dropped into version 2.
Themes in Magento 2 have the concept of variations of the same theme. So a theme can have different CSS and images but use the same templates, this can be configured per store per user agent in the admin. This is useful if you have different seasonable themes that are the same as each other but with a few different images and colours. To achieve the same in Magento 1 you would have to use packages and Magento&amp;rsquo;s ability to cascade up, this is not longer necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This development release of Magento has a major focus on updating the theme and template system to be more ridged unlike Magento version 1 where the template files could be basically any where within a theme.&lt;/p&gt;
