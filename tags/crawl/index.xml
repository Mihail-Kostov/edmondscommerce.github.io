      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of our Magento SEO service, the first thing we do is to make sure there are no issues with the crawlability and general health of the clients web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst working on the Google Webmaster Tools crawl errors for a client I noticed one specific and intruiging problem for which I couldn&amp;rsquo;t immediately see the reason, everything looked to be set up perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain URLs were getting 404 responses. The URL was being parsed by mod_rewrite but everything looked fine so why was apache giving a 404?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem turns out to be that the URLs contain escaped slashes (eg search/KTA-mb667k2%2F2g),&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that Apache actually handles the escaped slash and helpfully converts it to a real slash. That then means that it is trying to look in a sub folder that does not exist and hence the 404.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chances are you don&amp;rsquo;t want escaped slashes to really be thought of as real directory separating slashes, especially if you are using mod_rewrite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is a simple one liner to be added to your vhost.conf or httpd.conf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
AllowEncodedSlashes On

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
